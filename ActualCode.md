Actual Code
===========

Formal Computing education seems misaligned with it's learners.

A manifesto about what we want to do:
* We don't care about your 'syllabus' or your 'business objectives', 'grade boundaries' or 'OKRs'
* We enjoy just prating around with computers, we are interested and curious
* We actually want to build something with code, because we can - not because we somebody set us a lame task to meet their own addenda
* We don't video our sessions or demos because we prefer to talk to real people rather than cameras and screens
* Our greatest assets are our passion and the people around us


* We are tired of people teaching boring theory when those teachers can't actually do anything with code themselves
    * lame talk about networks but can't send an actual TCP packet to another machine

* If you regularly attend our sessions you have the identity of a coder
    * The process of coding is hard and uncomfortable
    * You may not enjoy the process of coding (yet), but if you develop a rich enough skillset (over years) you will not just enjoy it. 
    * You could deeply love the process and use your skills to augment your life and the people around you.
