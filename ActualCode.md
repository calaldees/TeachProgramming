Actual Coders
=============

Formal Computing education feels misaligned with it's learners.


Manifesto
---------

* We don't care about your 'syllabus' or your 'business objectives', 'grade boundaries' or 'OKRs'
* We enjoy just prating around with computers, we are interested and curious
* We actually want to build something with code, because we can - not because somebody set us a lame task to meet their own addenda
* We love being creative and building pointless stuff
* We don't video our sessions or demos because we prefer to talk to real people rather than cameras and screens
* Our greatest assets are _our passion_ and the _people_ around us
* We are tired of teachers shovelling us boring theory when those teachers can't actually do anything with code themselves
    * Lame talking about networks, but nobody in the room can send an actual UDP packet to another machine
* We don't care about categorising people. We're going to engage in actual code with other actual human beings
* If you regularly attend gatherings with other coders you will take the identity of 'a coder'
    * _Identity_ comes before _skill_
* We know the process of coding is hard and uncomfortable
    * You may not enjoy the process of coding (yet), but if you develop a rich enough skill-set (over years) you will not just enjoy it ...  You could deeply love the process and use your skills to augment your life and the people around you.
    * (But getting there is years of getting your ass kicked)
* Nobody can _get good_ alone
    * 'Talking about code' is time consuming, but 
        * Creates better quality results
        * Helps everyone grow in skill
    * To build anything complex, we have to work in teams
        * Making meaningful change is not a solo sport

We want to Actual(ly) code


Concept
-------

12 year old absolute beginners, to professional developers, and everyone in between

Audience
* School students (KS3, KS4, KS5)
* Undergraduates (from multiple institutions)
* Local community wanting to upskill
* Junior developers (and beyond)

Same evening each week - free food
All skill levels welcome


### Activities

* Pair problem of the week
* Showcases
* Theory (towards qualifications)
* Themes (demo's, direction, starting points)
* Self directed space to just chat and code
* Just sitting around and having free food

Getting buy-in

    BCS Learning and Development Specialist Group: https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/member-communities/learning-and-development-specialist-group/
    BCS Early Careers Executive (includes apprentices) https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/member-communities/bcs-early-careers-executive/
    Talk about speaking with execs (2 versions):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTP4kIy6C8I
            1. One outcome away from being publicly fired
            2. Executives are just people. They are lonley because of the power disparity. Can't trust what people say to you.
                * Every decision is either typei:cant-go-back typeii:can-be-reversed
            3. They don't know everything, but people expect them too. Imposter syndrome. Be careful about the assumptions you make (jargon)
                * Ask them to explain the problem they are having to you
            4. Speak truth they can trust
