Actual Coders
=============

Formal Computing education feels misaligned with it's learners.


Manifesto
---------

* We don't care about your 'syllabus' or your 'business objectives', 'grade boundaries' or 'OKRs'
* We enjoy just prating around with computers, we are interested and curious
* We actually want to build something with code, because we can - not because somebody set us a lame task to meet their own addenda
* We love being creative and building pointless stuff, because we can
* We don't video our sessions or demos because we prefer to talk to real people rather than cameras and screens
* Our greatest assets are _our passion_ and the _people_ around us
* We are tired of teachers shovelling us boring theory when those teachers can't actually do anything with code themselves
    * Lame talk about networks, but can't send an actual TCP packet to another machine
* We don't care about categorising people for some kind of virtue signalling metric. We're going to engage in actual code with other actual human beings.
* If you regularly attend gatherings with other coders you will take the identity of 'a coder'
    * Identify comes before skill
* We know the process of coding is hard and uncomfortable
    * You may not enjoy the process of coding (yet), but if you develop a rich enough skill-set (over years) you will not just enjoy it ...  You could deeply love the process and use your skills to augment your life and the people around you.
    * (But getting there is years of getting your ass kicked)
* Nobody can _get good_ alone
    * 'Talking about code' is time consuming, but 
        * Creates better quality results
        * Helps everyone grow in skill
    * To build anything complex, we have to work in teams
        * Making meaningful change is not a solo sport

We want to Actual(ly) code
