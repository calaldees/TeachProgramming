* Your confidence level wont change
* The first time you solve anything it is rubbish
    * The first to understand the problem
    * The second to make a solution
    * The third to do it properly
* Reading others code and talking about code accelerate your development massively
* Paper and pen dramatically augment working memory
* You cant rush code
    * It's just impossible - it's not like an essay - you cant rush correctness
    * When you reach mental fatigue, more time wont solve the problem
    * 4 times longer than your estimate
