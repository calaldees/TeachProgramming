Coding Truths
=============

* All computers can do is compare 2 numbers (or a single character)
    * Everything you ever write always comes down to this
* Your confidence level wont change
    * It's part of you. Every time you get more competent, you can now conceptualise the complexity of more complex stuff
    * [List of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms)
* You will code things 3 times
    * The first to understand the problem - The first time you solve anything it is rubbish
    * The second to make a solution (but it's less than optimal)
    * The third to do it properly
* Reading others code and talking about code accelerate your development massively
* Paper and pen dramatically augment working memory
* You cant rush code
    * It's just impossible - it's not like an essay - you cant rush correctness
    * When you reach mental fatigue, more time wont solve the problem
    * 4 times longer than your estimate
