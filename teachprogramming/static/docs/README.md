How to teach Computing
======================

* Spec given to students
    * Spec bingo -> tick + ask
* CheatSheet - encourage freely move between languages
* Projects for the year (in advance)
    * Autonomy and responsibility
        * Any order
        * Optional extensions (with indication of grade/skill/ability)
    * tackled in any language (see cheatSheet)
    * Lessons become consultations
    * Leverage peers
        * Code reviews
        * Pair programming
    * Theory covered by practical tasks
* Public repos
    * Version control
    * Transparancy
* Automated tests
    * doctests
    * auto assessment to spec?
* Automated questions + answers
    * for individual
* Guided projects (bank of)
    * Actually create something
    * Sense of achievement
    * Accessible independently
* Final self directed Personal project (A-level project)
    * Culmination of skills
    * Create a game?
    * Hardware? HCI? Output DMX?
* Meta-cognition (concept?)
    * Structured Retrospectives
    * Process + actions
* Group Wiki (concept?)
    * Publicly visible?
* Peer Mentor (with a big enough and multiple generation group)
    * Learners are paired with (slightly) more experienced mentor
        * The course lead can pair appropriately by ability/personality
    * Servant leadership
    * Could be external?
* Show cool relevant cultural stuff
    * Decentralisation
    * Snowden/Privacy
    * AI examples - Deepfakes?
* Hack time presentations (concept)
    * bring something cool?
    * Show feature/tool you've encountered
* Encourage participation at an event
    * HackDay
    * BarCamp (local tech culture meet/present)
    * Competitions (british informatics olympiad? robotics?)
* Real Exam (gcse or A-Level)


* Principles
    * Theory _when needed_ and interesting dynamic
    * Creativity/Choice
        * Hard timetable, tasks are authoritative and hierarchical - this establish's a non desireable mode of thinking
    * Developer Culture
    * Low stakes at ALL stages
    * No competition / hierarchy / judgement
        * Their progress is under their own ownership
    * Participate in community


> Seymour Papert introduced the Logo language in the 1970s and watched how children got excited by computing and learned how to think computationally. He attuned Logo to children's interests; even so, it still took students time to move from the fascination of the introduction to the ability to program useful computations regularly.
