* [ECT Python Program: Theme Park Ride](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Hu-ZJz2p4dyYzyYgjZeORWuLX8PVfcFn7i8MZpPFHM/edit)
> Word problem on estimation:  There are 90 people in line at a theme park ride. Every 5 minutes, 40 people get on the ride and 63 join the line. Estimate how long it would take for 600 people to be in line.

## Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
context-free language == methods that can be used to describe the syntax of programming languages
bnf describes syntax in unambiguius way
```bnf
<intger> ::= <digit> | <digit> <integer>
<digit> ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
```
integer is a set
digit is a terminal
