Creative Coding Workshop
========================

Could be a whole day event at uni or a module at GCSE level.

WIP Outline

* Time
    * Day = 2 hours (combined) of talks (not all in one block) + 4 hour independent code in informal environment + Showcase?
    * Suggest 09:00 till 16:00?
* Objective
    * Create a program that creates any visual animation from code (takes no realtime user input)
    * Be as creative as possible, learn something new, just enjoy the exploration
    * Showcase what you build at the end of th day if you have something (optional, no pressure)
* Attendee Prerequisites
    * Some coding knowledge of the fundamentals (any language)
        * loops, functions with params and returns, range of data types, arrays, dynamic collections, sin, modulo, random, min, max
    * (will show examples in Python, Javascript, C#)
* Talks?
    * Why?
    * Demoscene (30min)
        * History
        * Examples
    * My Examples + Code (15min)
        * DNA Logo (DOS/Pascal 15 years old)
        * Pygame zoomer
    * Describe algorithms for effects (5min each)
        * Random shapes (squares and circles)
        * Scrolling Stars
        * Particle Shower (mass/velocity)
        * Fire

            * Windows screensaver - algorithm - quadratic line * 4 -  draw over black/last - draw next
                * bounce points around screen (dvd image bounce)
        * Draw Binary Pascals Triangle
    * Techniques
        * Sin waves for visuals (10min)
        * Easing functions (10min)
        * Perlin noise (15min)
        * PCM Audio (from bytes) (15min)
        * Midi arpeggio


* assessment/measure? because we are obsessed with this
    * Complexity of code
    * Use of librarys
    * Asthetic
