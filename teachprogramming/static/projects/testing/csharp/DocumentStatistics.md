==================

* Create graphical template with text box to "word count".
    * (Thanks to Alexios for this exercise)

* The provided cs code is broken
    * Investigate with debugger
    * Fix program
        * (low hanging bad fix) `while (index < text.Length && !char.IsWhiteSpace(text[index]))`
* Setup a xUnit, NUnit, or MicrosoftUnit test sister project
* Write unit tests
    * Think of 5 test cases
* Refactor the code to use bounded iteration (without having to type crap into box's and run it repeatedly)
* Feel and understand the power in writing tests and then using tests
