=================

The beginning of a lifetime journey of exploring and understanding programming languages.

Ethos
-----

* Every Language was created to solve a particular problem
* Every Language is good for something


Objective
---------

1. Identify a range of programming language features
2. Be able to begin reason about the choice of a language for particular tasks


What do you know already?
-------------------------

TASK: Whiteboard
* TASK1: Name as many languages _features_ as you can
    * Extension: Can you categorise them? (!)


Overview
--------

* We will explore a range of features in mini activities
* I will then ask (with responses on whiteboards)
    * What is the purpose of the feature? What problem is this feature solving?
    * Why is this features good?
    * Why is this feature bad?
