Final Thoughts
--------------

Many language features seem like good ideas, after years of use and scrutiny people begin to know the impact of the feature. Once it's part of a language features can rarely ever be removed as so much code is written to use them.
Languages fall out of favour and new ones are always trying new ideas.
