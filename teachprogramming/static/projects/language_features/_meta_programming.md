### Meta Programming

* [MetaProgramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) Wikipedia
    * > a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running

* [[reflection]] - program inspecting itself while running
    * Some say this is unneeded as the language could support this itself
* Changing the structure of the program while running (is this a good thing?)

* [Macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Parameterized_macro)
    * Static languages
