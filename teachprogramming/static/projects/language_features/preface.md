Preface
=======

This book is my attempt to present a model for holistically teaching Computing.

It's impossible to fit an entire concept into a few works, but I describe the ethos of my approach as 'Authentic Participation'.


## What is Computing


(expanded in [[mostDontNeedComputerScience]]). Digital foundations are different from computing. My argument/approach is for those to develop actual skill in computing as opposed to the generic abstract light approximation that is delivered by mainstream curriculums
Most people don't need to code. Most people will never dedicate enough time to develop the depth of skill required to use those skills for anything of meaningful value to others.

## Who is computing for

Computing is not for everyone.

Most people could do with more literacy, thinking skills, digital literacy, they don't need Computing.

For those that actually want concepts that actually develop skill

'Anyone can code' considered harmful

Provide the fertile ground/foundations for the skills to grow.

I attempt to describe the environment, board brush strokes of what the process might look like.

## Why teach computing

The foundation of the digital world we live in.
We don't have a subject called 'pencil'.

Most institutions are driven by grades. The approaches here wont raise school grades. This is not a book about gaming the system. Goading young people into courses that make the institution look good is not my idea of success.
If you need students to just 'pass the GCSE this'

## Who can teach Computing

Only the skilled (or those who want to be skilled). It's not part time.

Many teachers are skilled at delivering material.
Professional educators are not professional software engineers.
So the people teaching Computing often can't create software to solve a real wold problem.
Teachers are the people that can create the experiences and environment that young people need to grown in computing.

This book is aimed at Computing teachers that feel something is lacking in the current education environment and want ideas to break the cookie cutter mould. Push beyond mediocre and become exceptional.

Buckle up!
