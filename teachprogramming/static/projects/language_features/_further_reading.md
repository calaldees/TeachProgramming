        * JavaScript dynamic’s nature, it’s possible do add properties and functions to an existing instance.
    * Kotlin: extension functions/properties
    * Go: implicit interface implementation
    * Clojure: "dependent types"
    * Elixir: pattern matching

    * Object oriented (example in Ruby)
    * Functional (example in Racket)
        * Pure == never store state, never modify inputs
        * Data and procedures are separate - oo data and procedures are intertwined
        * Prefix notation (rather than infix) - allow single operator to operate on a list
        * Easy to test, reuse components and concurrency
    * Logical (example in Prolog)
        * Describe _what_ not _how_
        * Variables/Constants, Facts, Rules (specify relationships between facts)
        * _ancestors_ example
        * programs can run backwards and forwards finding missing value
    * Procedural (example in Assembler)
        * two register A and D
        * no multiplication, division
        * constants go to A
        * Jump if eq, lt, gt
