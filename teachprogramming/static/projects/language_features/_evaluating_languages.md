Evaluating Languages
====================


### Less is more?

* [Less is more: language features](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/04/13/less-is-more-language-features/) Mark Seemann 2015
    * Venn diagrams visualising languages features compared to possible errors and valid code

### Language Evaluation Criteria

* [Evaluating Programming Languages](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/evaluatingprogramminglanguages/)
    * > So, if you ever get into an argument about programming languages, what should you say?
    * Criteria for Evaluation • Popularity • Understanding Evaluation Tradeoffs
* [Language Evaluation Criteria](https://progr-harrykar.blogspot.com/2018/11/language-evaluation-criteria.html) 2018
* [Design Criteria for Programming Languages](http://jcsites.juniata.edu/faculty/rhodes/lt/plcriteria.htm) 2015

Some criteria
* Read-ability
* Writ-ability
* Reliability
* Cost
* Generality
* Extensibility
* Standard-ability
* Support for internationalization


### Complexity?

```c
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) printf("hello"); /* How many lines of code is this? */
```
