> Each daily game uses a word from a randomly ordered list of 2,309 words (out of the approximate 13,000 five-letter words 

> Multiple instances of the same letter in a guess, such as the "o"s in "robot", will be colored green or yellow only if the letter also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray.
