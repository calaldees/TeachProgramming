Pair Programming
----------------

* Pair programming IS slower - but the quality of the result is higher
* Aim to
    * Talk 50% of the time
    * Type 50% of the time
* Methods
    1. Plug two keyboards into one machine
    2. Take turns with keyboard (driver and navigator)
    3. Live share
* Don't use the word "No" - (stretch your vocabulary) use - unlikely, probably not, unsure, possibly
    * Psychology of "Yes and" in improvisation
* You may not _like_ your partner - you have to communicate professionally
* Choice of partner
    * This week: You choose your partner
    * Next week: I will allocate you a partner
* Focus talk on "the problem"
