    * when a second language is encountered
        * A carryover concept (similar meaning in both the old and new context)
        * A changed concept (different meaning in the new context)
        * A novel concept (completely new to the learner)

Analogy? Students taught many lingustic languages at once to improve them all - they can say the name of farmyard animals in 4 languages, but can't hold a conversation in any of them.

TODO
====

* double, float MIN, MAX, NAN +INF -INF, EPOC?
* for (bounded) while (unbounded)
    * bounded where possible
* prefer data/code over if tables
    * see 'humanise' and 'sea level depth - color selection' projects
* functions should be pure (where poissible)
    * dont build + get url in one method - prefer reuse
    * doctests help conceptulise this
* 'static' bad
* reflection
    * in dynamic languages you need to know what `type` something is

* tcp server + client
* UDP example send receive
* draw shapes (graphics/canvas)
    * mouse move/click?

    * Same thing in multiple programming languages
