Computing Education: 
the missing bits?
the holistic approach?
the wider story?
zero to hero?


Chapter Concepts
----------------

* Part 1 - The problem
    * Why Computing - not just for jobs
    * What is missing
        * Is computing for everyone
        * Most people cant do shit all with a computer (really) - 
          * 
        * Most people don't know how the world works. Do they need to? DNS? Cookie? Why WiFi6 is better for power. Privacy?
        * Computing is power
        * What's not in the curriculum - IDE's, collaboration, diff, general automation
          * https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/about-us/news-views/decoding-digital-skills-gap-report
          * Most people of working age don't have them - this has significant cost to the economy
          * https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/
            * https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/piaac.html Dec 2024
          * AI not useful if they cant get data to it
        * GUI's suck
          * Move things, cant automate, cant reproduce, cant describe,
          * People can't use gui's because they can't type fast enough.
          * Exploration takes longer?
        * What is difficult to teach - networks
        * What stops computing teachers doing this - time, skill
          * most people need help with just understanding googledocs and styles
        * Verbal reasoning
            * can't explain the problem, cant explain the goal
        * Focus (the mobile distraction)
        * Best content has already been created and accessible - why is everyone not awesome?
        * Online, AI and the future fo education
        * Interview whiteboard
        * Authentic (problems worth solving)
        * Runbook for stuckness
        * Context
        * Different ages and stages of learners (are they that different?)
        * Computational thinking - what can they do? I agree with Denning
        * Am I old fashion? We need AI, big data skills - do we need to teach the foundations (numbers in binary) - it's uneeded boring
        * Nobody knows CS - even people that think know
            * Dijstras rant 1989
        * Technology built on technology built on technology - how is anyone ment to penetrate this
* Part2 - ideas?
    * Principles
        * Comunity, low stakes, no hireachy, real, creativiy/autnomy, presentation, wiki, progress visible (spec)
            * Zone of proximal Development what is possible with community support
        * children develop faster when they are not with other children
        * not games - this trivialises the diciplin
        * time/space/environment, disciplin, focus
        * Blooms taxonly does not work in this domain
    * Pillars
        * Practical Theory Exercises (self paced, multiple language)
            * unpluged only to faciliitate real
        * Engineering examples
        * Creativity
        * Community
            * rubber duck, pair, verbal, build after others, identity
        * (multiple langauges - false carryover concepts)
            * Understanding conceptual transfer in second and subsequent programming languages Ethel Tshukudu and Quintin Cutts (University of Glasgow)
        * (context)
    * Practical as a vehicle for theory
    * Guided Engineering projects
    * Creativity - what end of the trumpet to blow into - self directed
    * Equipment - cost? access? schools? portable?
        * Space
        * Scavenge old computers for linux (kind of difficult now)
    * Ongoing skill development
        * Constant (show have time - self directed)
        * CS graduates that don't know CS
    * Assessment
        * Test center, verbal presentation. because digital artifact are not suffect (citation - I know I have some)
        * leadership (assessed in PE)
        * real national qualification
        * function -> function that calls a function, iteration -> nested iteration
        * Code review (digital artifact + lead/explain presentation + as participant interaction) (live marked)
            * scaffolds and age appropriate
    * ActualCode - formal education is misaligned with learners
    * Projects
        * (SSDD)
        * Escape room
        * shapes (creativity) scratch, turtle, canvas/tk/.NetForms
        * Networking KS3,4,5,degree,professional
        * web-tech
        * Blockchain?
        * Cloud? CICD?
        * Cybersecutiry?
        * AI?
        * The lens of Games - what activities to choose and why
    * Teacher collaboration on resources
        * Missing meta and how to overcome it

* A lens of computing for a path to actualisation of ideas
* What industry can learn from formal education - what formal education can learn from industry

        * todo .. it kind of says nothing?
* [Popular education in Sweden: much more than you wanted to know](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tjxgbovwc5Ft7wrtc/popular-education-in-sweden-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-1)
    * > Folkbildningsrörelsen: that is the name we have for this movement of self-organized study groups, resource centers, maker spaces, public lectures, and free retreats for personal development. 
* "Conversational programmers"
* missing "Metadata" on sharing lesson content/calaborators - they why
* Meaningful targets - Feedback that get's actioned - progress that get's identified
* Individual at the center - growth - aligned with business/curriculum
* Most graduates if given a whiteboard pen can't converse with you
    * social skills (not sitting silently)
* Hack time and culture - social pressure - how to manage this effectively
* Junior to senior? definition? framework? framework for progression? proposal? benchmark statements?
    * investigate other frameworks
* Feedback was missing in industry - left to own devices - daunting
* one-to-ones with line manager - not whinges - actions and timeframe - always talk about the long

Real things don't score highly as year 13 AQA Projects

More chapters
* Spear-phish the shit out them - keyloggers - why hands on security matters
    * Build html email - links that are identifiable (path/query string)
* Typing speed - not on the sylibus - diff, github, collaboration, code-review/merge
* Creativity: microbit (escape room group), wearable (costume), demoscene greets
    * why each activity works
* Maruders map, demoscene greets, Chromecast clone (press the button whack a mole with people)

* Average human capacity in computing/problem-solving. Time/Experience. Value (commercial?/personal?) Time is finite. 
    * What do people 'need'(?) to know to provide value in this domain?
    * are computing qualifications fit for purpose for the future?
    * Future AI - is there the time for most people to understand the foundations of computing?
        * Consider "programming skill getting rarer" decades of coding experience (as currently perceived) to be a thing of the past
    * A lifetime of exploring programming problems means I can talk with young people about soliving a sudoku, huffman compression, rsa. I did not have that knowlege leaving university. 
    * In 2005 students were crying out to learn to code. In 2020 they hate being forced to code, it's hard and abstract and no real value (without decades of effort/time and most are not willing to invest)
* Access to high quality information/resources (that are up to date) has been solved. There are more skills computing people in the world now than in 1990. THe key ingredient is "personal interest" which is a requirement for investing "time". Young people are pulled from pillar to post and are stretched for time. Time is the number one ingredient
  * Expanding on that
    * 1 Time (The number number number 1)
    * 2 IQ (not repeat the same pattern a million times and change nothing). Asks self: How can Eddie Van Halen do that and I cant
    * 3 Talk to other humans - be able to ask questions. Seek out others interested in similar things

Most people cant to much with a computing
manipulate date (scrabble around in excel, get data from a souce and refine/combine)
automate actions (create scrips, links things together, trigger dataflow)
autonimously create something (most people are give a constrained task)

to get to a level above you need 360 guided learning hours and probably more
in year 7,8,9 they get 30 hours a year maximum
A GCSE is 60 hours

The only way to get the exposure (time) and challenge (approriate difficuluty) is self direction

Comunity


Not everyone needs to learn how to code
* [Not Everyone Should Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFwa5Owp0-k) YouTube PolyMatter

Two opposing feelings
  1.) Learn something?
    brain teaser - understanding concepts
  2.) Build something?
    make something cool - disect it later

* [Project-Based Software Engineering Curriculum for Secondary Students](https://doi.org/10.1145/3605468.3605501)
    * Abstract
        * > There has been a growing interest in software engineering (SE) education to prepare K-12 students for the workforce. 
        > Despite the relevance of SE education for K-12 students, most of the available instructional units lack detail and are limited for large-scale use [27]. 
        > Previous research has also indicated that educators fear that SE concepts are too complicated for secondary students [14] 
        > ... Gutierrez et al . confirmed that primary and secondary students are more than capable of comprehending SE concepts [13].
    * > We use a block-based learning environment that connects to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which, in turn, provide students with a wide range of online datasets to use in their projects. 
    * > Human-Computer Interaction, Prototyping,
    * > virtual week-long summer camp
    * "Computer Science Frontiers" as a follow up to "AP Computer Science Principles" (see below)
    * Create (performance task)
        * develop a computer program of their choice 
            * Submit program code 
            * video of programm running - text is fine - no voice narration
        * The Create performance task requires at least 9 hours of dedicated class time for students to complete. The end-of-course exam is 3 hours long and includes 70 multiple-choice questions and 4 written response prompts related to their Create performance task. 
            * Indentify inputs/outputs, funcitons, reational operators

    * > block-based systems built around structure editors almost exclusively used for early programming instruction to young learners,
      > and professional environments that use text-based languages and are edited at character level.
      > Here, we argue that combining the two approaches into a single system can have benefits. We discuss frame-based editing, a combination of text and blocks, and its potential to improve the landscape of programming education

    * >  As a subject that is often considered vocational in nature, computing students also need to demonstrate standard skills of employability, which lacks an overall infrastructure (Fincher & Finlay, Reference Fincher and Finlay2016)

* [Principles of Educational Programming Language Design](https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/797/info)  Michael Kölling   2024
    * > why is this still an area of fundamental disagreement among educators?
    * > discuss the relative benefits of pedagogical languages vs. industry languages and articulate why every generation of learners needs their own language.
* [hacker news comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42427428)
    * a lot of pushback about the article - we simply dont know how to teach programming
    * I find the core position of the author unconvincing - that is, the author advocates for non-professional languages for beginners, instead using languages designed specifically for teaching. The main argument put forward in favor of professional languages is crossover: if a student learns a language in class, they may be able to use that language professionally. The author then argues against that main point.
    * I think students should be taught in "professional" languages, but crossover is not my main reason. Rather, it's that professional languages have an enormous corpus of examples that students can look up. If a student is learning on a teaching language without much adoption, there's just not much else a student can do but use the materials that part of the course. Teaching languages don't let students expand their universe of examples.
    * I agree with the author's point about real insight coming on learning the second (and third, etc.) language and systems. But I don't find it as a compelling point in favor of teaching languages - quite the opposite. To me it means there's no need to obsess over first languages.

        * > Skills can be lost as well as maintained and enhanced over time.
        * > The quality of education and training offered at different levels of the education and training system can vary considerably between countries and, within countries, over time. Thus, the level of knowledge and skills certified by a qualification of ostensibly the same type and level may vary widely.

    * Complexity of the tooling - why doom-modding was so popular (find doom aniversary interview video with remoemo and carmak)
    * Consider tracker for disecting and making music over a full DAW

* text languages
    * problems with brackets
        * 4 of them `{([<`
        * They are used to mean a range of different things
            * Python `()` - tuples (immutable), maths/logic order of evaluation, generator, function params
            * javascript `{}`, Define and object, code block, destructuring, importing
            * `[]` used for defining and access - same for lists defined with `[]` but also dicts defined with `{}`
    * Quotes
        * 3 of them `"'` and backtick
        * trebble-quotes? escaping?


* Learners love external visitors
    * But this is not the same as curriculum progress. It's very easy to be 'entertained' by a guest speaker but not necessarily make progress
