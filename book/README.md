Mad idea - consolidate my resources and ideas in some form of publishing.
I think I need to start with a book proposal.

I need to start sketching out a chapter list ...

Title

Needs word-smithing

Computing Education: 
the missing bits?
the holistic approach?
the wider story?
zero to hero?


Chapter Concepts
----------------

* Part 1 - The problem
    * Why Computing - not just for jobs
    * What is missing
        * Is computing for everyone
        * Most people cant do shit all with a computer (really) - 
        * Most people don't know how the world works. Do they need to? DNS? Cookie? Why WiFi6 is better for power. Privacy?
        * Computing is power
        * What's not in the curriculum - IDE's, collaboration, diff
        * GUI's suck
        * What is difficult to teach - networks
        * What stops computing teachers doing this - time, skill
        * Verbal reasoning
            * can't explain the problem, cant explain the goal
        * Focus (the mobile distraction)
        * Best content has already been created and accessible - why is everyone not awesome?
        * Online, AI and the future fo education
        * Interview whiteboard
        * Authentic (problems worth solving)
        * Runbook for stuckness
        * Context
        * Different ages and stages of learners (are they that different?)
        * Computational thinking - what can they do? I agree with Denning
        * Am I old fashion? We need AI, big data skills - do we need to teach the foundations (numbers in binary) - it's uneeded boring
        * Nobody knows CS - even people that think know
            * Dijstras rant 1989
        * Technology built on technology built on technology - how is anyone ment to penetrate this
* Part2 - ideas?
    * Principles
        * Comunity, low stakes, no hireachy, real, creativiy/autnomy, presentation, wiki, progress visible (spec)
            * Zone of proximal Development what is possible with community support
        * children develop faster when they are not with other children
        * not games - this trivialises the diciplin
        * time/space/environment, disciplin, focus
        * Blooms taxonly does not work in this domain
    * Pillars
        * Practical Theory Exercises (self paced, multiple language)
            * unpluged only to faciliitate real
        * Engineering examples
        * Creativity
        * Community
            * rubber duck, pair, verbal, build after others, identity
        * (multiple langauges - false carryover concepts)
        * (context)
    * Practical as a vehicle for theory
    * Guided Engineering projects
    * Creativity - what end of the trumpet to blow into - self directed
    * Equipment - cost? access? schools? portable?
        * Space
    * Ongoing skill development
        * Constant (show have time - self directed)
        * CS graduates that don't know CS
    * Assessment
        * Test center, verbal presentation, digital artifact not suffect
        * leadership (assessed in PE)
        * real national qualification
        * function -> function that calls a function, iteration -> nested iteration
        * Code review (digital artifact + lead/explain presentation + as participant interaction) (live marked)
            * scaffolds and age appropriate
    * ActualCode - formal education is misaligned with learners
    * Projects
        * (SSDD)
        * Escape room
        * shapes (creativity) scratch, turtle, canvas/tk/.NetForms
        * Networking KS3,4,5,degree,professional
        * web-tech
        * Blockchain?
        * Cloud? CICD?
        * Cybersecutiry?
        * AI?
        * The lens of Games - what activities to choose and why
    * Teacher collaboration on resources
        * Missing meta and how to overcome it

* A lens of computing for a path to actualisation of ideas
* What industry can learn from formal education - what formal education can learn from industry
* [Popular education in Sweden: much more than you wanted to know](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tjxgbovwc5Ft7wrtc/popular-education-in-sweden-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-1)
    * > FolkbildningsrÃ¶relsen: that is the name we have for this movement of self-organized study groups, resource centers, maker spaces, public lectures, and free retreats for personal development. 
* "Conversational programmers"
* missing "Metadata" on sharing lesson content/calaborators - they why
* Meaningful targets - Feedback that get's actioned - progress that get's identified
* Individual at the center - growth - aligned with business/curriculum
* Most graduates if given a whiteboard pen can't converse with you
    * social skills (not sitting silently)
* Hack time and culture - social pressure - how to manage this effectivly
* Junior to senior? defention? framework? framework for progression? proposal? benchmark statements?
    * investigate other frameworks
* Feedback was missing in industry - left to own devices - daunting
* one-to-ones with line manager - not wingesd - actions and timeframe - always talk about the long
