BarCamp 2024
============

I wasn't intending to present this. Most of my thoughts are not fully formed, but I hope consolidating some ideas in a talk will help me work though some ideas. I figured that this talk would be reasonably universal and interesting to the attendees at BarCamp.

* How did you learn your tech skills?
	* Write on paper

<details>

Thing

</details>

* Not everyone should code. There are way better things long term they can work towards that are more useful.
* Everyone should enjoy building something with autonomy (and that could be with code)

The only way to get the exposure (time) and challenge (approriate difficuluty) is self direction




Same Surface Different Depth (SSDD)

Perception of Computing in the world compared to the Computing qualification
----------

What is young peoples experience/perception of Computing?
* Mobile phones? Youtube? ChatGPT? Hackers? VR? 3D open world games?
* Now you enter your GCSE class and we do
  * Hex to binary
  * 3 months of network theory
  * (Neither of those are relevant to the young persons)
* The GCSE is not relevant to most young people


Qualifications vs Certification
---------------

Academia is broken untrustworthy shit - CS graduates that don't know CS and cant build anothing.
Cirtification?



Assessment
----------

* Complexity (11 years old + can use this same grid)
	* Have you used a variable?
	* Have you used a function?
	* Have you used one paramiter?
	* have you used two paramiters?
	* Does your function return something?
	* Does your function call another function?
	* Have you created a function that calls itself?
	* Do you have a loop?
	* Have you used bounded iteration
	* Have you used unbounded iteration
	* Have you used a loop within a loop
* > “The spirit and style of student assessment defines the de facto curriculum.”  Rowntree (Reference Rowntree1977)

Why is networks always only taught as theory?
Use Dig, whois, bitwise xor a subnet mask, use curl -vvv, send UDP packets
The multisocket server



Learner Autonomy
----------------
Learner Autonomy rather than 74 exercises in order.

I failed - learner experiment 52 weeks over lockdown. Motivated learners. I layed out a fantastic 52 weeks of perfect progression. I failed to take into account automony. If all a learner does is move on to exercise 37 out of 78, it does not work.
Only a small minority can access this education.
Q: What demographic/characteristics can access this education?

<details>

* Obedient (indoctrinated that education is important)
* Affluent (the learner has a quiet space to focus - Most children don't have access to a desk and quiet space. Just their mobile phone in a shared bedroom)
* Autistic?
</details>

### Children should be bored

* [Children should be allowed to get bored, expert says](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21895704) BBC March 2023
  * To develop autonomy and creativity
  * We have robbed our young people of this opportunity

Identity Comes before skill
---------------------------

* Example: "The guitar kid"




Typing speed
------------


Pair Programming
----------------

* If you can say it or write it, your don't know it
* Equal access.
* That's how you actually build something
* (kid in the bedroom just strumming the same chords and noone to tell them the way there wrist is angled is preventing them from making progress)


Cheat Sheet
-----------

https://computingteachers.uk/static/langauge_reference.html#py,vb

* Learners understand the abscract concepts, not the particular incarnation of brackets
* Learners feel they can progress (another language is not that hard once you know the concept in one language)
* l33t hax0rs can do the exerciers in lua, C or golang while the rest of the class are plodding though in python. (Even 6th formers)


Projects
--------

* Font + Demoscene
* Disco Lights + Chromecast
* Marauders map? (concept)
* Engineering projects (diffs: many computing teachers don't know what this)
  * Copter, Chat, NetworkWhiteboard
* Real
  * Escape room
  * Wearables (creativity)

* etextiles - wearables - fashion
    * Strips of LEDs

Make something ..see it work ...  then disect it

Visual abstractions are not effective

Build actual shit make it real

* https://github.com/calaldees/channelServer


* Web Module - add a feature after someone else
* Frameworks and Languages


Hardware
--------

* You cant code on a mobile phone or tablet

Lesson Meta
-----------

* [Pedagogy by proxy: developing computing PCK through shared lesson resources](https://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/13728/) Hidson, Elizabeth (2021)
  * Most lesson resources don't include metadata about _why_ the approach was chosen



Undocumented
------------

* Largely, my computing education work is undocumented.
* They are not documented enough for another computing teacher to utilise them
* I have considered a _book_? But have no idea where to begin
