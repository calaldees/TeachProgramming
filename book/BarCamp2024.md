BarCamp 2024
============

* I've worked in secondary schools, taught at HE/University, contracted to run code clubs, trained secondary computing teacher across Kent.
* I have left education.
* I wasn't intending to present this. Most of my thoughts are not fully formed, but I hope consolidating some ideas in a talk will help me work though some ideas. I figured that this talk would be reasonably universal and interesting to the attendees at BarCamp.


* How did you learn your tech skills?
	* Write on paper

Preface: Computing Education Sux
--------------------------------

### Expectation vs Qualification

* Q: What is young peoples experience/perception of Computing?
  * Mobile phones? Youtube? ChatGPT? Hackers? VR? 3D open world games?
  * Now you enter your GCSE class and we do
    * Hex to binary
    * 3 months of network theory
    * (Neither of those are relevant to the young persons)
  * The Computing GCSE is not relevant to most young people
* Q: So what is important for young people?
  * The grand answer: Self actualization and altering the world though self action and building
  * The simple answer: Choose to build shit

### Qualifications vs Certification

* Academia is broken untrustworthy shit - Many CS graduates don't know CS and cant build anything - Many courses are of poor quality
* Professional Citification are gaining momentum and prove competence in a field rather than ephemeral low value CS degrees



Solution (Part 1 or 2): The intangible fluffy stuff
----------------------

* Not everyone should code. There are way better things long term they can work towards that are more useful.
* Everyone should enjoy building something with autonomy (and that could be with code)

The only way to get the exposure (time) and challenge (approriate difficuluty) is self direction


### Children should be bored

* [Children should be allowed to get bored, expert says](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21895704) BBC March 2023
  * To develop autonomy and creativity
  * We have robbed our young people of this opportunity

### Learner Autonomy

Learner Autonomy rather than 74 exercises in order.

I failed - learner experiment 52 weeks over lockdown. Motivated learners. I layed out a fantastic 52 weeks of perfect progression. I failed to take into account automony. If all a learner does is move on to exercise 37 out of 78, it does not work.
Only a small minority can access this education.
Q: What demographic/characteristics can access this education?

* Game-ification of content errodes autonomy and should not be used
  * > You get 50 stars if you complete this exercise - you have 279 stars currently - your next level of silver is at 300 stars
  * This is not developing intrinsic motivation and puts the leaner as a controled subject rather than developing there own automomy


<details>

* Obedient (indoctrinated that education is important)
* Affluent (the learner has a quiet space to focus - Most children don't have access to a desk and quiet space. Just their mobile phone in a shared bedroom)
* Autistic?
</details>


### Identity Comes before skill

* Example: "The guitar kid"


### Stop using ...

* 'Games' to teach programming
  * The entirety of all of computing ... and the only think you can think of that has worth is trivially using it for entertainment. Thats lame.
  * Focusing on games alienate some demographics and trivializes the discipline.


Solution (Part 2 of 2): The tangible stuff
-----------------------

### Assessment

Students need a framework to:
* identify where they are
* rate/rank/measure/critique others

It has to be something an 11 year old can do. and scale to 18+


* Complexity (11 years old + can use this same grid)
	* Have you used a variable?
	* Have you used a function?
	* Have you used one paramiter?
	* have you used two paramiters?
	* Does your function return something?
	* Does your function call another function?
	* Have you created a function that calls itself?
	* Do you have a loop?
	* Have you used bounded iteration
	* Have you used unbounded iteration
	* Have you used a loop within a loop
* > “The spirit and style of student assessment defines the de facto curriculum.”  Rowntree (Reference Rowntree1977)

Why is networks always only taught as theory?
Use Dig, whois, bitwise xor a subnet mask, use curl -vvv, send UDP packets
The multisocket server


### Same Surface Different Depth (SSDD)



### Typing speed



### Pair Programming


* If you can say it or write it, your don't know it
* Equal access.
* That's how you actually build something
* (kid in the bedroom just strumming the same chords and noone to tell them the way there wrist is angled is preventing them from making progress)


### Cheat Sheet

(foundation to use all languages without fear)

https://computingteachers.uk/static/langauge_reference.html#py,vb

* Learners understand the abscract concepts, not the particular incarnation of brackets
* Learners feel they can progress (another language is not that hard once you know the concept in one language)
* l33t hax0rs can do the exerciers in lua, C or golang while the rest of the class are plodding though in python. (Even 6th formers)


### Guided Engineering Projects

(build something with low skill set - see what is possible)


* [channelServer](https://github.com/calaldees/channelServer) - WebSocket, TCP, UDP - Echo server
  * The secret network sauce
* [Copter](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/docs/copter.py.pdf)
* [MessageBoard]()
* [Font](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/projects/graphics/font/font.md) + Demoscene
* [Disco](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/docs/disco.pdf) Lights + Chromecast
* [Chat](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/docs/Network%20Chat%20(js%20python).pdf)
* [Map](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/projects/web/harry-potter-map/index.html) Marauders map? (concept)
* Engineering projects (diffs: many computing teachers don't know what this)
  * Copter, Chat, NetworkWhiteboard
* Real
  * Escape room
  * Wearables (creativity)

* etextiles - wearables - fashion
    * Strips of LEDs

Make something ..see it work ...  then disect it

Visual abstractions are not effective

Build actual shit make it real



* Web Module - add a feature after someone else
* Frameworks and Languages


Hardware
--------

* You cant code on a mobile phone or tablet

Lesson Meta
-----------

* [Pedagogy by proxy: developing computing PCK through shared lesson resources](https://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/13728/) Hidson, Elizabeth (2021)
  * Most lesson resources don't include metadata about _why_ the approach was chosen



Undocumented
------------

* Largely, my computing education work is undocumented.
* They are not documented enough for another computing teacher to utilise them
* I have considered a _book_? But have no idea where to begin
* As I have left the education profession. I currently have no outlet to education and much of my work is set to be left to atrophy
