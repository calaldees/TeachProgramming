Academia Vs Certification
-------------------------


Academia or Certification
-------------------------



Academia + Citification
-----------------------



---

In compting qualifications
Everyone is trying to push their own version of the coolaid
There own brand
There own assessment

Universities - stop re-inventing shit!
Use certifications as your assessment
Setup as. Pearson Test Centre - get external revenue

NCCE Citification to check teachers knowledge
They had their own assessment scheme, and people to administrate it. What a waste of time and resources. And did the people that got the certificate feel they knew the full GCSE spec; No because it wasn't the GCSE.
Just use the GCSE?!


---

Dear Education Institutions,
Stop making new forms of final qualification/citification/assessment
It's a waste of your time
Existing system exist

As professional educators, focus on assessments that helps the lerner grow in the domains you need them to.
You don't get to decide what those things are, because the foundations of Computing are the foundations of Computing.
You need to focus on the 'How', not the 'What'

### Access to Information

In the 1970's and 1980's, it was a commonly held belief that the 'poor' were poor because they did not have the opportunity to access information.
Huge amount of funds were invested into public libraries.
We now have the internet, everyone has unfettered access to the best information on the planet.
Are they smarter and more informed .. no
So it wasn't 'access to information' that was the problem.

### Access to personalised feedback

It must have been that there was no way of getting the right level of information and personalised feedback.
So now we have LLM's that can provide personalised support and guidance. Instantaneous ongoing feedback 24 hours a day.
Are they smarter and more informed .. no

### Focus Space

'Access to Information' and 'Access to Personalised Feedback' do not seem to makes a difference ...
So is it just IQ/G? I'm not so sure. It seems correlated.
I think it's 'Environment and Expectation'
It's really hard for young people to engage with a cognitively difficult task when there is no quiet space in the house. When there are siblings running in and out and the television(?)/phones-without-headphones is on.
A smartphone and a bed is insufficient. If you don't have your own room with a door you can close with a desk in, you wont be able to progress. A young person must have access to focus space and a desk. In my carer I have asked students about their facilities at home, I have been surprised how many students don't have this. I would like to see some data (TODO).


[[trust]]
No; we tell young people they are clever it disarms them
(Similar principle to complementing women on their looks - it's substanceless praise)



The four ingredients
IQ/G + focus + mentor (role model / environment / leader) + peers/network/social



Single minded stuborn focus - unrelating focus - focus to a point where they young perseon cant see the value in anything else, engagement is the most important thing


So what's the most important factor?

I think all 4 are more or less equal in importance
You can largely get by with being exceptional/advanced at two of them
But if you can bingo hit all 4 like a jackpot - the fruit machine just keeps on giving

What can be done to enhance some of these?
In the outcome of a single individual the most important factor in the individual learner
A teacher has influence over 3 out of the 4 pillars.
Teachers are the single biggest catalyst for an explosion of achievement,

I think it's more common to have a solo exceptional teacher then it is to have a great teaching team. The problem is alignment.
Unless the team are truly aligned [[alignment]]
The more members of teaching staff you add, the higher the chance that they are not aligned.


Teaching and Probational Software Engineering are two separate professions.
We can't expect teachers to be able to build software.
We can't expect engineers to be able to teach.
Teachers need to be guided and supported with activities and patterns.
My goal is to give an example path

Many learners will never get to experience a great mentor
Mainly because structurally, the wrong incentives are in place for education establishments.

The conundrum
Most people are at a skill level too low to be employabley useful.
Most organisations do not have a way of upskilling people in a meaningful controled way if they cannot contribute.
The selection process is currently messy.


Practice your scales


At university level
You separate the assessor/certifyer from the teacher - I think this is important.
Removes bias, clear separation


Olympiad - see where you are
Hack day - see where you are

3 months to do one simple example
You have 3 hours to it for real

* Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently offered a peek into one of his life’s decisions and how the value of higher education is changing in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking to a new generation of engineers at Stanford University recently, Brin said that while the “Stanford-to-Silicon-Valley” pipeline remains legendary, his own path to becoming a tech leader was defined by curiosity rather than a strategic pursuit of credentials.
* “I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he told the student gathering, while adding, “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”
* Brin’s comments came at a time when there’s a narrative that the rise of AI is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. For example, AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT are becoming increasingly capable of writing code, many students have questioned whether a computer science degree remains a viable investment. Brin cautioned against fleeing the field out of automation fears.

    * Qualifications are problematic because
        * > Educational qualifications certify only the knowledge and skills developed through a course of study. As a result, they provide information only about a subset of the skills of an individual
        * > Skills can be lost as well as maintained and enhanced over time.
        * > The quality of education and training offered at different levels of the education and training system can vary considerably between countries and, within countries, over time. Thus, the level of knowledge and skills certified by a qualification of ostensibly the same type and level may vary widely.
