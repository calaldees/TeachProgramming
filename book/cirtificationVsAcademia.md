Academia Vs Certification
-------------------------


Academia or Certification
-------------------------



Academia + Citification
-----------------------



---

In compting qualifications
Everyone is trying to push their own version of the coolaid
There own brand
There own assessment

Universities - stop re-inventing shit!
Use certifications as your assessment
Setup as. Pearson Test Centre - get external revenue

NCCE Citification to check teachers knowledge
They had their own assessment scheme, and people to administrate it. What a waste of time and resources. And did the people that got the certificate feel they knew the full GCSE spec; No because it wasn't the GCSE.
Just use the GCSE?!


---

Institutions
Stop making new forms of final qualification/citification/assessment
It's a waste of your time
Existing system exist

As a teacher focus on assessment that helps the lerner grow

Poor did not have access to infroamtion
Libraryies
We now have the internet they have access to information
They don't have the attention and personal feedback - they have chatgpt and llms they have the best intantainious feedback.
Are they smarter and more informed .. no


None of this makes a difference ... 
IQ or G .. is that all it is

[[praise]]
No; we tell young people they are clever it disarms them
(Similar principle to complementing women on their looks - it's substanceless praise)



The four ingredients
IQ/G + focus + mentor (role model / environment / leader) + peers/network/social



Single minded stuborn focus - unrelating focus - focus to a point where they young perseon cant see the value in anything else, engagement is the most important thing


So what's the most important factor?

I think all 4 are more or less equal in importance
You can largely get by with being exceptional/advanced at two of them
But if you can bingo hit all 4 like a jackpot - the fruit machine just keeps on giving

What can be done to enhance some of these?
In the outcome of a single individual the most important factor in the individual learner
A teacher has influence over 3 out of the 4 pillars.
Teachers are the single biggest catalyst for an explosion of achivement,

I think it's more common to have a solo exceptional teacher then it is to have a great teaching team. The problem is alignment.
Unless the team are truly aligned [[alignment]]
The more members of staff you add, the higher the chance that they are not aligned.


Teaching and Probational Software Engineering are two separate professions.
We can't expect teachers to be able to build software.
We can't expect engineers to be able to teach.
Teachers need to be guided and supported with activities and patterns.
My goal is to give an example path

Many learners will never get to experience a great mentor
Mainly because structurally, the wrong incentives are in place for education establishments.



Practice your scales


At university level
You separate the assessor/certifyer from the teacher - I think this is important.
Removes bias, clear separation


Pointless little gerble wheel jobs


Olympiad - see where you are
Hack day - see where you are

3 months to do one simple example
You have 3 hours to it for real
