Gamification
============


#### Game-ification is counter to autonomy

* Game-ification of content erodes autonomy and should not be used
  * > You get 50 stars if you complete this exercise - you have 279 stars currently - your next level of silver is at 300 stars
  * This is not developing intrinsic motivation and puts the leaner as a controlled subject rather than developing there own autonomy
  * I would consider this strategy over the long term dangerous.
