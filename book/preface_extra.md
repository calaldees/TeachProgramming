How teaching computing is different to other subjects - the struggle of authenticity
-----------------------------------------------------

Other subjects are the same, in that they strive for authenticity/context.
I think in the case of computing, as a prractical diciplin, I feel the subject is significantly hurt to a point where it's almost unrecodniseable how computing in schools translates to doing anying the real world with computers

Teachers construct the exercises for the level of the students.



Compting Teachers do not have professional time to teach and also build software.
The best exercise are those that are attached to an authentic domain.
Teachers are not professional network engineers or bioinfomations.
The majority of computing teachers need guidance of pre-completed tasks that the teacher then adapts to their context.
It is often hard for teachers to understand the pedagogical choices of the person that has constructed a leraning exiernece.
Sometimes the creator of the task is a great 'network engineer' but has no understanding of the path to pre-requiste knowlege blar
