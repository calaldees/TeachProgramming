Age: When is too young?
-----------------------

Summer code club workshops

9 year olds
can't understand
can't copy

If they can't look at text and look at their keyboard
'play spot the difference' what looks out of place?
This is not a code aptitude problem, this is a pre-requisite skill problem. A time and attitude problem. A mental fatigue problem. If they are spending their full conative load on copying accurately, they have no left over cognitive capacity to understand what the code is doing.

Even after explaining parts of the code and using technical terms, reenforcing the technical terms on the board. The learners were totally preoccupied with getting the program to work and copy without caring about any of the rest, "just make it work for me".
Quizzing the technical terminology yeilded confusion. They saw all the rambling of the old man in front of them irrelevent.
So did the activity yield any meaningful value?

They loved it? They wanted to work more on their games. They found it hard, but were somehow drawn to it, even though they were frustrated and confused. Maybe it was all worth it.

If they can't create the logic themselves (or a least understand what the code is doing), they can't debug it.
Time to debug? Nobody has the time to do that in class, they run out of options

blocks to text pedagogy (not clear, limited correlation)

build language and maths skills and enjoy creating/autonomy. Time can be spent raising typing speed and measuring that (with symbols)
Drag pictures around, see things move, enjoy it. Pushing young people into text based languages too early will be demoralising and of limited value.

exercise the 'pattern of focusing' but largely trying to convey specific content may be wasted effort
