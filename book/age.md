Age: When is too young?
-----------------------

Summer code club workshops

9 year olds
can't understand
can't copy

If they can't look at text and look at their keyboard
'play spot the difference' what looks out of place?
This is not a code aptitude problem, this is a pre-requisite skill problem. A time and attitude problem. A mental fatigue problem. If they are spending their full conative load on copying accurately, they have no left over cognitive capacity to understand what the code is doing.

Even after explaining parts of the code and using technical terms, reenforcing the technical terms on the board. The learners were totally preoccupied with getting the program to work and copy without caring about any of the rest, "just make it work for me".
Quizzing the technical terminology yeilded confusion. They saw all the rambling of the old man in front of them irrelevent.
So did the activity yield any meaningful value?

They loved it? They wanted to work more on their games. They found it hard, but were somehow drawn to it, even though they were frustrated and confused. Maybe it was all worth it.

If they can't create the logic themselves (or a least understand what the code is doing), they can't debug it.
Time to debug? Nobody has the time to do that in class, they run out of options

blocks to text pedagogy (not clear, limited correlation)

build language and maths skills and enjoy creating/autonomy. Time can be spent raising typing speed and measuring that (with symbols)
Drag pictures around, see things move, enjoy it. Pushing young people into text based languages too early will be demoralising and of limited value.

exercise the 'pattern of focusing' but largely trying to convey specific content may be wasted effort



Is 9 years old too young?
Scratch? But transfer to text is hard?
Text; just typing on a keyboard and being exposed to it
The most important thing is that do not become demotivated
Failure == you create an activity that demotivates or discourages the learner. Your concepts could be well intentioned, but if they feel that Computing is not for them, they will disengage from future activities.
They appear to learn nothing - quiz them on keywords - give them one line problems.
Just leave them 2 years to 11 years old. They have dramatically cognitively increased. Physically and mentally, an 11 year old will decimate a 9 year old. The vast majority of people are in the bell curve.



Illusion of self identifying "I'm good at this" "I enjoy this". It's an illusion. A con. A constructed misdirection, but as a useful one.


"Look what you built"
But they didn't. All they did was copy the example, but making them feel like 'they achieved' something, must continue.
I am more interested in the young persons ability to persevere and focus than I am the output. Engagement == winning.
The reality is "Look what you built (with guidance)"
(This is the common education model of 'Zone of PCD')
[[trust]]
As your students mature, I would be more explicit about calling out 'what they did themselves' and 'what they did with support' and 'what they are currently unable to achieve'. You need to do this for your students to trust/respect your guidance. Always saying how 'good' they are gives them no direction.
This subtle gradient is what separates expert practitioners from average practitioners.
This can be called out explicitly with [[metacognitionReview]] tasks. What were you able to do yourself, what were you able to achive with support. What were the things you needed support with?
