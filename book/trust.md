Trust
=====

Same mechanisum for good/bad
Why, the behaviours we want to see and why

No matter how bad the performce of the student, the students turned up, praise that, they will get these with time.
If they are not turning up, it's time for a discussion about what is best for the student

Over the years working in a range of software companies
Pattern with CEO's
CEO "I'm your friend" "Get back in the office and work dickheads"
Lack of trust/misdirection
Dear CEO's, every time you do this, you look like a skizo. You are not a hard nosed badass who makes cutting decisions but is also a realistic and caring person, you're full of shit.

Actually have respect for the business leaders that are just money focused, give no appologies and get the job done. They are consistent.

Trust

For anyone in a leadership role, be it industry or teaching, the consistency of your character should be clear. Stop fake niceness, purposeful communication.
Be emotionally consistant with your students/employees



Teacher/Learner Parity - Partners in Learning
----------------------

Separating For Teachers and For Learners is already failure - I would

### Teachers Should ...
Give learners the tools, don't hide stuff from them.
Your mythical grand plan is not a secret beyond there comprehension. It's not too much.

### Learners Should ...


### Commentary

I'm not going to write two books. One for the perpective and learners and one from the perspective of teachers. The teacher is the one with the experience knowlege and power to create the learning invironment and guide the patterns. Asking young people to raise their game by giving them a book on their attitude and education is unlikely to success, but giving them excerpts and pointing them at items is exceptionally useful. That is why this book has every paragraph numbered. They can be referenced.

Give them chapters of this book to read. Explain to them why you have constructed the learning the way you have. What you are trying to exercise. Your learners are partners in their learning, they are not second rate citizens

What do you think learners think of the teacher that shares this with them?
Others: It blows their mind! They never thought about their own development this way before. They feel empowered. They feel valued.
Some will ignore the gesture. Some wont care. Some wont be able to make the mental leap. Consider it irreverent. Just turn up each day to swallow the next airplane spoon of content.
