Preface
=======

This book is my attempt to present a model for holistically teaching Computing.

It's impossible to fit an entire concept into a few works, but I describe the ethos of my approach as 'Authentic Participation'.

## The curriculum disconnect

Many school computing curriculums feel abstract and disconnected from the digital world young people experience:
* We teach: logic gates, bytes, for loops, network theory
* Young people see: hacking, ai, social media, vr
It's difficult for young people to see the relevance of the academic curriculums with the future skills they need for their lives.

But these school curriculums do actually cover some of the fundamental foundations of computing, so why do young people feel so distant from them?

(reword) the answer is getting to a high enough level of skill that the theory makes sense and means something. Until that point, it's largely abstract disjoined nonsense.


## What is Computing

To align our terminology; My model and defection of computing (or what I call 'actual computing') may differ from your understanding of the term.

Digital Skills, Digital Foundations, Digital Literacy, IT Skills

Computing, Computer Science, Software Engineering

The analogy I once heard: To drive a car you don't need to know how to clean a carburetor.
(But it can help you choose a car, or fix it at the roadside with a pair of pliers and a cable tie)
A terminal, log access, and understanding of json data format to correct a missing comma

Digital foundations are different from Computing. My argument/approach is for people to develop actual skill in computing as opposed to the generic abstract light approximation that is delivered by mainstream curriculums.

Education institutions have a duty to help people build Digital foundations, but that is NOT Computing. I would ask education leadership to ask the question "What are we teaching Computing for". You might find that education leadership has a very different perception of Computing to you.


## Who is computing for

Computing is not for everyone.

Most people don't need to code. Most people will never dedicate enough time to develop the depth of skill required to use those skills for anything of meaningful value to others.
Most people need foundational skills to participate in the digital world. Most people don't need computing.
Most people could do with more literacy, thinking skills, digital literacy, they don't need Computing.

For those that actually want concepts that actually develop skill

'Anyone can code' considered harmful

Provide the fertile ground/foundations for the skills to grow.

I attempt to describe the environment, board brush strokes of what the process might look like.

(expanded in [[mostDontNeedComputerScience]])


## Why teach Computing

The foundation of the digital world we live in.
We don't have a subject called 'pencil'.

Most institutions are driven by grades. The approaches here wont raise school grades. This is not a book about gaming the system. Goading young people into courses that make the institution look good is not my idea of success.
If you need students to just 'pass the GCSE this'


## Who can teach Computing (Who is this book for)

Only the skilled (or those who want to be skilled). It's not part time.

Many teachers are skilled at delivering material.
Professional educators are not professional software engineers.
So the people teaching Computing often can't create software to solve a real wold problem.
Teachers and parents are the people that can create the experiences and environment that young people need to grown in computing.

This book is aimed at semi experienced Computing teachers that feel something is lacking in the current education environment and want ideas to break the cookie cutter mould. Teachers wishing to push beyond mediocre and become exceptional.
I consider the growth of actual computing skill largely agnostic of age.
Secondary school though to degree level have the same foundation principles.
The maturity of the learners may change your approach (Pedagogy/Andorgy).

I'm aware that most professional teachers are not software engineers (nor should they be).
I intend to offer teachers guidance with 'authentic'(ish) applications/experiences to link the abstract computing curriculums into practical meaningful projects/activities/outcomes.

Citation for Leadership

(Although not the intended target audience; this book could also be useful for technical parents that want to convey more powerful concepts, but are unsure of the steps to get there. It could also provide parents with a background of what to look for in when selecting schools/universities or guiding more formal computing growth)


## Validity of concepts (reword)

How do I know I'm right? The answer; I don't

I've tried to cite where possible my sources.
Education Research is difficult. There are to many variables.
(reword)
By the time you've collected enough data about a teacher, it's too late, it's a career. How do you measure. To many variables. Was it the intervention? how do you distill the methodology into general purpose teaching advice.

Teachers themselves are the best placed to judge if a particular method is effective. They know their young people and their context.

My hope is that computing teachers can use this book as an idea/inspiration factory as a catalyst for their own teaching. Some of the concepts will resonate, some may not. Rather than prescribing doctrine; It is up to the reader to integrate the useful concepts into their own pallet of teaching.


## Against the advice in this book

Reality

Scale. Most teachers are not as skilled or experienced
Must be done to 10,000's of students

NCCE Resources

I don't know how to teach computing in every context.
Again; I hope this a catalyst


## A future we know nothing about

My mum was beside herself with tears. My spelling and handwriting were considered 'sub standard' when I was young. She worried about how I would ever be employed. She worried for my future. I said "Don't worry mum, I'll just use a spell checker" and she snapped "There wont always be a -king spell checker". Fast forward to the future workplace, there is always a spell checker.

We need to conscious that any skill, process or subject adults want to instill in the next generation, is based on our present understanding. It's difficult for us to prepare young people for a future we know nothing about.

My hope is that many of the concepts discussed here survive the test of time. With the rapid advancement of AI tools, the future of Software Engineering and Teaching are set to be significantly disrupted.

Computers are just 0's and 1's. Anything we can do to enhance peoples understanding of the foundations of Computing will be a valuable skill in an ever increasingly digital world. Some of the concepts around the process of how we 'build foundational understanding in computing' should hopefully still hold weight.

## The stage is set ...

If that all makes sense to you, you're in the right place. Buckle up! Let's discuss a different approach to Computing
