Girls and Computing: The Elephant in the Room that is not a real elephant and is largely irrelevant but I can't write a book about Computing without addressing the arm flapping around this topic


Attempt to cut through to what I think are the core commonly held mental bocks

How do you do this
* Have rapport and respect from the student body
    * Be Skilled, strong, fair(justice/balance), human
    * Get their trust
    * Crude Translation: If your not very likeable or skilled, no students are going to work with you
    * The first barrier to girls in computing is 'you' the teacher
    * You are the ambassador of your subject. For must young people are you are the only example they know of someone skilled in your domain. Young people don't have much life experience. If you're an difficult person, they will hate your subject.
* Ask some of the older revered (head girl material), come and help with a few open days or support a few func technical activites in a year
    * Uni girls to come and work with a class (they don't have to studying computing, they just need to know more than the young people they are working with)
    * Female participation will be de stigmatized

This has much more effect than an Ada Lovelace poster


Computer Science is subject of academic study.
Computer Science is nothing to do with
* Violent videogames or the toxic comunities around videogames
    * Advertising to this subset group of of computer users
* Wage gaps
* Mental health and social media
* Computer Science != Digital Skills



If the goal is to push women into STEM subjects, and more do join the profettion. For this to happen an inverse proportion of men need to be displaced into these roles. You cant have one side of the equation.
If we accept one side of this and not the other, we have an incomplete system.
So we must equally encourage men to take up the roles of nursing and primary school teaching.
Imagine tell a room of very focused autistic teenage boys that are interested in computers that they would be better off helping in these other professions. They will need to expand their empathy and work with others to perform these needed roles in our society.
Some might find it distasteful if I prominently place posters about working in these areas in a computerroom. "Do you want to study Computing? Think again! We've got an alternate profession for you!"

The global assumption is that the only acceptable ratio is 1:1 50%male:50%female.
I don't think the numbers of girls taking computing is the focus of the problem
My fight and focus is about opportunity of access
There should be no girl that given the opportunity to engage with computing.

A single computing teacher cant control 
* the macro globel economics of the entire workforce.
* the entire social state of society
What a single computing teacher can control
* Curriculum design

It's a single bulletpoint ... teachers can control what they teach.
See rest of book - Authentic participation and relevent contect to young people

Context
* Games trivialize the entire domain of Computing. (It's degrading to think that the only use of computers is entertainment)
* Stop using games to teach computing. (As an extra curricular engagement tool: sure! but not in your mainstream teaching)
    * If you do use games in your curriculum, use this VERY sparingly and explicitly call out the trivial nature of games (games are cool, but ultimately trivial)

Games and Gamification should be removed
