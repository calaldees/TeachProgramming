Degrees offer this!
Foundations again - and you know what, most entrants can't do it

Music degree without playing an instument
An art degree without a portfolio

80% have to pass. OFS office for students
So the entrants have no computing prerequestits - they are a bum on a seat that yields £30,000 and 80% of them have to pass

Grade inflation
38% firsts degree 2021

A Level computing 7%

Degrees are not trusted by employers


A-Levels are understood
A-Levels are a national sport that every entrant is participating in

    * 300% growth in last 10 years
    * A-Level computing enrollments - In 2013 it was 3.5k, by 2022 it was 15k - in 2024 it was 19k - It's growing
    * Look at the grade bump 2020
    * So the introduction of the GCSE in 2014 has made no deference in any way to A-Level results ... why do we bother with GCSE's then? Does education do anything? or has the A-Level got harder?

    * 150k places in Computing (related)
    * 60k Computer Science places (from ocr dude a few years ago) - most universities start again from scratch because they can't rely on compsci education in schools
    * (even with all the candidates and other BTEC pathways combined, 150k is massive! It's not an exageration to say that over half of the entrants do have a Level3 equivalent. They are starting form way back, which is why most degree's start from scratch again, because they can't guarantee the backgrounds of the entrnts. That says to me that their recruitment process is not sufficent (maybe deliberatly so, because they just don't care, 80% of them will pass anyway))

Academic achievement does not == immediate employable skills.
But academic achievement (when graded as a % nationally) does convey aptitude.
If you can sit down in a chair long enough and focus on something, you're probably useful to an employer.
If you cant prove/manifest that via academic qualification or portfolio of projects, you will struggle to be employed in the domain.
