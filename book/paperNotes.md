You can't use, read, watch, someone else's content. It does not work.
Rule: You MUST generate your own content. Your own notes. Your own code. Your own tutorials. Your own examples. This portfolio is what can be reviewed. You also rewrite from your notes. multiple generations. Keep them all.
I think the only way for this is paper. It's the only thing free of distractions. The only thing thats truly personal (you could photograph your paper notes for a friend, but it's largely meaningless)

Teachers should monitor the progress of ongoing written notes - although these are not formally assessed, missing notes are a flag for concern. Track with RedAmberGreen?

Regular Mock written exams with exam style questions. These should examin all previous toipics (spaced repetition). Should be close to the exam style but can be massively reduced in time (and of course the paper notes). These are formative.
One sheet of handwritten A4 notes allowed - This prompts learners to distill all the notes they need onto one page in preparation for the exam. The act of creating these distilled notes makes the learner review and rewrite meaningful notes based on their current understanding. Eventually there will be no need to write down many of the concepts as these will be internally modeled.
Borrowing others notes is fine, but copying them is of limited value. It is valuable however to consider what you may have missed? It's also perfectly acceptable to keep your notes to yourself. (Again explicitly call this out)
The act of copying from generations of notes is valuable - what of these notes do I need? When you run out of paper-space, you have to write it all out again and thus reinforcing and constantly evaluating what information is needed

Some might attack this as 'discriminatory'. 'My handwriting is bad - I am disadvantaged'. Counter to 'I NEED to print them'.
* Copy and paste is not the same conative process
* Freeform allows for diagrams, links/lines
* No batteries, power outages, latency
* Can't write?
    * You still need to write on the exam paper anyway. And if you can't write on the exam paper and be legible to the examiner, then that has other downstream issues.
    * Unless there is an extreme disability like missing a limb or mortor nurone desese, then writing is available and is a skill that should probably be improved
* The purpose is not to chastise, the purpose is for the learner to see where they are.

Nearer the real exam, you can have noteless mocks
