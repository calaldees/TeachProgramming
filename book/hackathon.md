So you want to run a Hack-a-thon?
=================================

I can't think of anything more human and amazing than a hack day. However; many people have heard they are great and want to jump on the hip and trendy bandwagon. All the right buzzwords are there "community" "young people". But so many people don't get it. And when they try to mimic the idea and call it hackday it can cause more long term harm disenfranchising people.
This is my notes on what the pitfalls are and how to do it with some degree of success.

* Prerequisites
    * Before you decide to run one - go to one (if you are not a technologist but an organizer, still attend and observe the event) - preferably more than one of them and speak to some of the attendees and organizers.
    * If you don't understand the event, how will you convince people to attend? If you do convince people to attend, they will probably have the wrong skill-set because you did not understand the event yourself.
    * Understand the skills your attendees will need in able to produce something meaningful (see curriculum below)
* Routes/Themes/Style
    * (just having 'anything goes' is to vague. If groups are too disparate, Attendees will wonder about the value of the gathering and wonder if they should have just done it themselves. There is no way for them to feel part of something bigger, or identify the skill that was demonstrated by the other teams because everyone worked on very different domains.)
    * Creative route
        * Demo-scene Font greets
        * Demo-group Team
        * Physical space (movement, lights, interacting with the real world)
    * Real Route - Meaningful community engagement (solving a real problem with real data)
        * Office for national statistics
        * Canterbury council data?
        * Kent council data?
        * Geo-relevant?
* Has to have meaningful output
    * Not just duck-taping cardboard together or making a mockup from powerpoint slides
* Need time to produce that meaningful output
    * This can't be done in 3 hours. Overnight of a weekend gives the minimum possible time to build anything
    * Sleeping bags under desks
    * Social - food pizzas in the evening - present on Sunday lunchtime to a wider set of spectators
    * Stop the pests - don't let non skilled people wonder and distract the hackers from the focus of the event. Have the metal to ask people to move to the separate 'party room' or leave
* Prerequisite skills of attendees
    * If your attendees have never processed data before, never created a dynamic webpage, never xyz, then how will they learn all the skills to do that AND create something in the compressed time. It would be difficult to create the thing in that time period, let alone learn the skills as well
    * Demo implementations (to convey tech and what is possible):
        * Heatmap on maps
        * Google sheets for storage
    * You may need multiple months of crash course session leading up to the event to demo and develop skills for processing real data
* Attendees need to know what the event is and have the concepts modeled/explained
    * Picking young people and expecting them to perform is foolish
    * They need to see the output of a real hack day to see what's possible and whats expected
    * You need 20% of your attendees minimum to know what they are doing and be role models for what is possible and model the approach
    * The reality is that most young people (even studying computing) will not have the skills required for this by just attending their course. Actually producing something practically in a constrained time and in a team is not the same as passing an exam or doing coursework.
    * The reason why people applaud and clap is because its genuinely impressive what people can do in 24 hours. If you don't have enough understanding of what development is, you won't know how amazing it is, you will just clap hollowly (or worse clap when the achievement is minimal). There is a real difference of an audience in awe and and just some hollow noise
    * Have a local community of people building projects (BarCamp)
    * Going from zero to hack day is a recipe for problems
    * Quality - Your event is only as good as your attendees. Weak attendees == Weak event. This is not an event for "everyone". Trying to involve everyone blindly will create problems.
    * Social media is good for raising the profile of your event, but it will not attract your skilled attendees. Your mindset should be focused on 'recruiting' skilled attendees. (look at the curriculum list below). If you can't find them, you need to make them, and that process could take years of support sessions before you run your first hackathon. Maybe your first hackathons are only with a small selected cohort of 12 people as a test?
* You can have good intentions and have an inverse effect
    * coding is hard - "anyone can code" is bullshit. If you open up a hack day for everyone you could just demoralize the weak attendees as they wont be able to produce anything
    * Unskilled attendees hurt the event - they provide distractions
    * Anyone that thinks "just run a hack day" is going to have a disappointing event and even put people off attending any future hack days organized by other people that might be good. Beware of the damage you can cause.
    * A related example
        * CC4G - ICT club for girls in 2004 was just an embarrassment - purple spreadsheets about ponies
* If the event can run regularly for 3 years, you will have enough snowball momentum for work of mouth to attract more people. What could be important is the length of time the event has been established. Potentially you may have you first 2 years as a buildup for the 3rd+ year being productive.
    * You know the attends from last year (everyone wins some kind of special mention/award because you gave a great set of awards). Contact them individually about the next event. Show you're aware of the hack they did. Make them feel valued and remember and that their contribution was important. You can have a template and notes from the previous year and back these out in an hour to 30 people.
    * The longer your event runs, the more meaningful and prestige the event holds (both internal and external). Organizations should be aware of the long term horizon can actively fight to keep the pattern/event going.
        * Can the organization commit to minimum of 3 years? can the organization name and identify a member of staff to be responsible. If that member of staff leaves, ensure there is a plan to pass the torch.
* Publish the results and have awards
    * Many young people use these days as CV material. Have a public website that describes each of the hacks and showcases them. This leads to the value of years of accolades enshrined on a page that can be linked to for years (see length in the game above)
        * Have a plan for the long term support of these urls. It helps SEO and young people cite the achievement for years.
    * When you judge the awards - it's not dragons den. Award creativity, skill, approach, passion. Make the special-mention/award/category mean something to the person receiving it.
    * It is NOT competitive. Participation is the key. I advise against awards like "Best in Show". I also advice against meaningless awards "Most likely to go to the moon".
        * Some ideas "Best Technology", "Best Team", "Local Hero's"
    * What if the young people had an experience with the supporting/sponsoring/judging companies
        * e.g. If you're a local railway provider - give the young people a day with a signal box operator and lunch with the mobile app development team
    * (One of the prizes I won once was an engineering day where we build HexaYerts and GridBeam furniture to put in the yert, solar power wiring and a composting toilet. Can you create prizes that further engagement)


Hackathon Prerequisites/Curriculum
-----------------------

The description above got me think about what would actually be needed beyond the basics taught by normal computing courses (if statements, functions and for loops, etc)

Here is a question - if you want a program to do anything and produce some meaningful output .. what do you need? You need to be able to:
* work with data
    * get data from somewhere
        * (api's? files?) know what formats to work in
        * input devices (events)
    * store some data in some way (memory? disk? structure?)
    * output data (charts? transcode? graphics? devices (rgb strips? speakers?))

With that in mind, here is a of core skills to allow that to happen.

### Essential skills
* Git (required to collaborate - if you want ANYONE to be able to work in a team)
    * push, pull, resolve merge conflicts
    * ssh rsa key generation (at least an understanding)
        * Prerequisite for git setup
* Data
    * Data formats (and libraries to read+write them)
        * csv, json
* Network
    * http (GET, POST)
        * request headers and response
        * url: subdomain, host, path, query string, hash
        * apis
            * know how to pass an authentication token
            * read docs autonomously (implement discord bots)
    * Use of at least one of tcp, udp, websockets
* ftp (get files onto servers)
* javascript
    * await fetch json
    * programmatic generation of html
    * events
* canvas drawing
    * shapes from code
* Import libraries
    * Be able to search, install libraries and read documentation

### Optional (very useful skills)
* data
    * use of structured database
        * sqlite?
    * use of google docs programmatically for free live datastore (great for quick hacks)
* encoding
    * base64
    * gzip
* web
    * Use a cookie
    * web layout framework (bootstrap - 12 col)
* commandline tools to leverage data
    * ffmpeg (video encoding/decoding)
    * pandoc (document conversion)
* graph generation
    * on any platform (Plotly? Chart.js?)
    * Put data on maps
* bash ssh and understanding of commandline
* Data handling
    * Get data from non technical users (input) (Google sheets as datastore trick)


### Commentary

The skills list is huge.
This takes years to acquire the core skills to produce anything meaningful.
You attendees need to at least know what most of these things are, even if they can't use them autonomously yet.
If you run a hackathon and 90% of your attendees can't do this, it's going to be a weak hackathon.
I would say that 50% of your attendees needs to have the capacity to create even simple pieces of software autonomously in a massively constrained time period.

I've been criticized about being unrealistic or misaligned with my tech list above. Some educators have questioned the validity of my suggestions as very few other institutions seem to agree on many of the items.
I'm going to pull rank on this one.
I am professional developer and hiring manager.
I have created personal projects all my life and attended many hack days.
I list these things because I can actually build things.
I know what can be built.
I know what young people are capable of.
I know what I'm looking for when interviewing new developers.
My suggested skills are largely in the right direction for 'Authentic Participation'.

If you do not understand what the items are above, you will be at a disadvantage when recruiting the right people and you be in a weak position to help learners build the relevant skills in preparation for the event.

Whenever I see an event being advertised with well meaning people smiling and saying "You don't have to be technical to get involved" this just detracts from what the event is aiming to achieve.
I see this attitude as the death knoll of a hackathon.
If you want excellence, you need to identify and appreciate excellence.
If you want it to be a social, inclusive and fun with some free food, that is a reasonable goal, but don't expect excellence.
This attitude of "you don't need to be technical" also detracts/devalues from the the young people that have put in significant effort to develop their skills, only to have a range of people just turn up and say "Anyone can do this and anyone can contribute". This undermines the significant difficulty and long term investment needed.

### Suggestion

* Run a hackday in a constrained domain and seed a few workshops before hand. e.g.
    1. run a few workshops on using rgb led strips and drawing graphics to a screen.
    2. run a hackday with a theme to convey beautiful art/fun computer controlled stuff around the venue to bring joy and wonder to somewhere
    * The winning teams will be given a small budget to actually install their creation longer term
    * e.g.
        * a Christmas tree that plays music and changes color to the music
            * [house example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWBjl-jPcVM)
        * whenever anyone walks into a toilet it plays the mario bros entering a pipe sound effect
        * A flip dott display over a doorway


History
-------

* 2024? I was asked for advice on setting up a hackathon for girls with local schools and undergrads. I waxed lyrical about my advice and wrote this document.
* 2025 I was asked about running a hackathon and significantly enhanced this document
