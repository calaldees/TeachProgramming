Lots to unpack here.

I feel for you.
This is a difficult situation. Leadership are misinformed. You have very little power. Even if you present a rational argument there are many social factors why the decision may not be able to be revoked.


-- Computing/Technician line management

I know of two experienced Computing colleagues that will only work in a school as a computer teacher under the condition that they line manage the technicians.
 - xxx (Borden Grammar)
 - xxx (Folkstone School for Girls)
They do not want technology or bureaucracy impairing their students ability to interact with computers or software.


-- Examples of supportive security structures

There are things that can be very beneficial to a school. e.g. I know of some schools that log keyboard input of all students and staff. When keywords or phrases that trigger a safeguarding concern the headteacher or safeguarding lead is notified with a digest and can choose the next steps. These are supportive structures.

Another good strategy would be send auto-generated phishing emails to all staff and students periodically with varying degrees of difficulty. You want your students and staff to click the Phish Alert Button (PAB). With this strategy you get stats on which of your staff are clicking stuff, and which of your students are clicking stuff. You can then target training to individuals and see how healthy your organisation is as a whole.


-- Blanket Security?

What security issues do they think they are solving by employing this policy?
This sounds like the overreaction of people with a weak understanding of technology and weak technologists.
All curriculum machines should be running profiles that prevent write access to system level components. (This is the default)
Rather than focus on prevention, organisation should consider swift and uniform recovery mechanisms. (e.g. an entire site can rebuild all of their curriculum machines via multicast or shadow partitions in less than an hour).
Data is stored (with multiple versions) on the cloud. Most computers are just thin clients anyway.
It would be good to know what the policy intends to cover and debuk each threat vector.


-- Uses of USB

Just using a web browser and a word processor is not Computing.
I ran a session recently about creativity with Computing including wearable computers and Arduinos. I've also done some DMX stage slight controllings with python. I also had some fun playing with an 80's bus flip dott display screen via a USB serial port.

I would also advocate deliberately teaching young people about keyloggers and using them in lessons (this also shows the power of 2FA keys (ironically also USB)).
The only way our young people are going to be able to spot security issues concerns and protect themselves are those that understand the dangers.
It's wonderful to see young people check the back of a machine before logging in. Priceless education!


-- Encouraging Security thinking in students

Cyber security specialists is a hugely valued occupation in society.
Who are the only people that can project an organisation? ...? well ... people that know the risks. Who knows the risks? Someone that is actually able to find weakness's or proof of concepts.

I would also would also advocate with students that want to "break" or "hack" the school network are actively encouraged to under the collaboration of computing teachers and school technicians. They can talk with the technicians about their plans to ensure no damage is done during the school day. The young people can get used to writing formal reports of identified security concerns.


-- Wider engagement with sharing software an ideas

I know of schools that have adopted similar mantras.
 - Westlands schools blocks all possible access to GitHub

I find this strips young people of a huge resource.

I want young people looking at all the amazing things the with is sharing and doing with code. I want them looking at github. I want them asking me how to launch a "docker container" to run the program that they want. https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer Just see how many young people actively ask for your help to run this. I want them looking at code, even if they don't understand it, the fact they can identify the value in it.

-- Recruitment

I tell me trainees this:
"Ask schools about their software and hardware security restrictions at interview. If you think anything will impair your ability to teach a high quality computing curriculum, raise it. If they are not open to changing or abolishing those before your start date, DO NOT ACCEPT THE JOB. This shows that the school is not committed to genuine good education and they will repeatedly not support you during your time there."
This is not an exaggeration. This is in my sessions.


-- Overall

Seymour Papert (the god-farther of computing education) said something like "Is it technology driving the child? or the child driving the technology?".
Miles Berry (professor of computing education at University of Roehampton) also espouses similar views. Technology only exists in schools to benefit the learners, it exists for no other purpose.

Schools should focus on supporting young people with their development and working with them rather than crude polices out of fear.
The fear stems from lack of understanding of technology from leadership and weak technical staff.
We cant teach computing without being able to use a computer.

I wish I could cite more literature and studies on this to aid your cause.

I can put you in touch with other computing teachers for you to be able to talk to them about the security policies they have in place and why they have set them up that way. This might give you some good live case studies.


Let me know how you think I can support.
