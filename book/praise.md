Trust

Same mechanisum for good/bad
Why, the behaviours we want to see and why

No matter how bad the performce of the student, the students turned up, praise that, they will get these with time.
If they are not turning up, it's time for a discussion about what is best for the student

Over the years working in a range of software companies
Pattern with CEO's
CEO "I'm your friend" "Get back in the office and work dickheads"
Lack of trust/misdirection
Dear CEO's, every time you do this, you look like a skizo. You are not a hard nosed badass who makes cutting decisions but is also a realistic and caring person, you're full of shit.

Actually have respect for the business leaders that are just money focused, give no appologies and get the job done. They are consistent.

Trust

For anyone in a leadership role, be it industry or teaching, the consistency of your character should be clear. Stop fake niceness, purposeful communication.
Be emotionally consistant with your students/employees
