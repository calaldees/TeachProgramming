Teacher/Learner Alignment
-------------------------

### Escape hatch's

In the past, code was an completely human process. It took time, trial and error and understanding. There was no google to lookup a stack overflow solution. There was no LLM agent (see [[effectiveAI]]).
I call these easy, low hanging fruit solutions, 'escape hatches'.
You had a reference manual and you had to think, try and ask others.
This process lead to a generation that truly had to understand what the computer was doing.
Every time a learner uses and 'escape hatch' they are deprived to some extent of the problem solving experience.
There is ongoing contention between 'getting shit done' and 'grappling with desired difficulty'.
[todo citation desired difficulty]

!!! teacher-action
    Teachers should care about 'the process' over the outcome and should have a range of strategies to explicitly manifest/assess the process. [[assessment]]


### Teacher/Learner Alignment

Teachers and learners need to have aligned goals to be effective.
Teachers need to actively work towards this alignment
By default, learners will always be reaching/preferring 'escape hatches'
We need to be transparent and clear with learners about these 'escape hatches' and encourage them to identify when they are grappling with 'desirable difficulty'.

!!! teacher-action
    Teachers should identify, encourage and praise when learners engage with 'desirable difficulty'.

Learners need to brought/explained on the journey of why the education path has been constructed in the way it has.


### Sharing the spec / learners as active participants in the journey

* Live by the spec. Play spec bingo each lesson. Student ownership and awareness.
* Give spec to students printed (4 to a page + Duplex)
    * AQA
        * AS=30pages -> 4 sheets A4 or A2=60pages -> 8 sheets of A4
