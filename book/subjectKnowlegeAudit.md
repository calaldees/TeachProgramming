Subject Knowledge Audit
-----------------------

What skills should a computing teach have?
How do new computing teachers know what to develop?

This isn't related to the curriculum. Was not an assessment requirement. Ignored it.
Some teacher are intimidated by the list.
Especially if they are significantly experienced teachers. Now confronted with a list from some abstract academic that is not actively practicing in the context of their school.

Should the list be reduced to the lowest common denominator?

If it's not on the exam, there is no time/capacity to do anything else, remove it.

"How are students doing to buy a domain name, this is irrelevant."
It's not a student task audit. It's a teacher knowledge audit. I would expect a compting teacher to know how to purchase a domain name and use it.
I would expect a computing teacher to talk about the difference between an `A` record and an `@` record and explain the `whois`.
