Literacy
--------

If you have never written, said or physically gestured it. You don't know it.
If you've done none of those things, there is no evidence that you can recall or use this knowledge.
This may start off a mimicry; the mouthing of the same syllables. the same gestures. But over time these will become more familiar and more authentic.

Goal: Precision (of communication)
Words for domain specific abstract concepts.
Better literacy/language/vocabulary, better thinking. They are intertwined.
