Literacy
--------

If you have never written, said or physically gestured it. You don't know it.
If you've done none of those things, there is no evidence that you can recall or use this knowledge.
This may start off a mimicry; the mouthing of the same syllables. the same gestures. But over time these will become more familiar and more authentic.

Goal: Precision (of communication)
Words for domain specific abstract concepts.
Better literacy/language/vocabulary, better thinking. They are intertwined.

Thing explainer (funny), but can only be done by an expert

Explain why you should do it one way over another


(In another section)
You can't use, read, watch, someone else's content. It does not work.
Rule: You MUST generate your own content. Your own notes. Your own code. Your own tutorials. Your own examples. This portfolio is what can be reviewed. You also rewrite from your notes. multiple generations. Keep them all.
I think the only way for this is paper. It's the only thing free of distractions. The only thing thats truly personal (you could photograph your paper notes for a friend, but it's largely meaningless)
