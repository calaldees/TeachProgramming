Space
-----

A physical space that can be identified by young people. It's purpose. It's feel.

Attendees/Learners should be contributing to the space/decoration/feel.
Posters? (not random posters of personal taste (bands/movies) or other unrelated stuff) But computery related. Memes. etc
"Does this make it a (computer) room?"
* Image of a keyboard key on fire (hotkey)
* Developers run on coffee
* Cat's at keyboards
* Digital signs, (flip dot display over door?), mario pipe sound when enter/exit? animated LED's
* Slideshows of photos of the group working - have a way for people to add to this (conversations about appropriate)


Equipment/Hardware/Tools
------------------------


Physical manifestations of the students "Authentic Participation"

Can we mount loads of tablets on the wall to display software?

Arcade cabinet? (Just joystick - touch screen mouse)


Focus
-----

Young people need to be guided to understand what focus is.

### Group space

Noise in office/leaning-environment. Learners must understand why we behave the way we do in shared space.

Teachers must
Convey the environment rules
Convey the reason for the rules ([[alignment]])
Enforce the rules

If any of those steps are missing, your environment will not function as expected




### Solo space: Deliberate practice
Explicit focus

Signal to others and yourself - "This is focus time"

shut the door
Put on the headphones (I don't think music helps. I think this reduces focus and trains dependence. There is the argument everyone is different, to a point, but I'm fairly adamant about this)
Consider ear defenders for focus time. Explicit?

Ask for others to support you in your goals

In an education environment? Concept: two computer spaces (next to each other. Proximity is vital!). Group space and focus space (silence; explicit)
