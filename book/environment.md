Space
-----

A physical space that can be identified by young people. It's purpose. It's feel.

Attendees/Learners should be contributing to the space/decoration/feel.
Posters? (not random posters of personal taste (bands/movies) or other unrelated stuff) But computery related. Memes. etc
"Does this make it a (computer) room?"
* Image of a keyboard key on fire (hotkey)
* Developers run on coffee
* Cat's at keyboards
* Digital signs, (flip dot display over door?), mario pipe sound when enter/exit? animated LED's
* Slideshows of photos of the group working - have a way for people to add to this (conversations about appropriate)

Focus
-----

### Group space

Noise in office/leaning-environment. Learners must understand why we behave the way we do in shared space.

Teachers must
Convey the environment rules
Convey the reason for the rules ([[alignment]])
Enforce the rules

If any of those steps are missing, your environment will not function as expected



### Solo space: Deliberate practice
Explicit focus

Signal to others and yourself

shut the door
Put on the headphones

Ask for others to support you in your goals

In an education environment. Suggest two computer rooms (next to each other. Proximity is vital!). Group space and focus space (silence; explicit)
