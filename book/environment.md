Age
---

Illusion of self identifying "I'm good at this" "I enjoy this". It's an illusion. A con. A constructed misdirection, but as a useful one.


Space
-----

A physical space that can be identified by young people. It's purpose. It's feel.


Equipment/Hardware/Tools
------------------------


Focus
-----

Noise in office/leaning-environment. Learners must understand why we behave the way we do in shared space.

Teachers must
Convey the environment rules
Convey the reason for the rules ([[alignment]])
Enforce the rules

If any of those steps are missing, your environment will not function as expected
