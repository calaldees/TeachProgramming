A Balanced Diet
---------------

A friend works as a probational japanese translation director for a large games company.
She self taught/studied japanese and moved to live there.
She gave a talk to aspiring language learners about her journey.
Her advice: a 'balanced diet'.

Just watching anime is not enough.
Little bit of duo lingo is not enough.
The only way to progress is purposeful study.
There is no other option.
There is a formal exam to rate skill in this domain. N5 to N1. Each level has a list of vocabulary, symbols and patterns formally specified.
The skills cover 4 key pillars
* Speaking
* Listening
* Reading
* Writing
Without all 4 pillars you are not functional at using the language.
I think most people can identify why those 4 pillars of learning a language lead to genuine language proficiency.

When we consider 'genuine computing proficiency', it's a little more difficult for the average person to identify what this is.
Most people can speak/read/write a language, but not everyone is proficient a using a computer.
Let's try to define what these pillars of computing might be in our attempt to identify a 'balanced diet' for computing.

Attempt to define the pillars of computing?
