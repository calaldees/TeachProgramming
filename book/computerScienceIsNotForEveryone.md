'Anyone can code' considered harmful
====================================

This is not an argument against education. This is an argument against misplaced education.

* Not everyone 'needs' to code
* Not everyone is capable of coding

"Everyone can code" is incorrect - retoric is harmful and leads to demoralization.
"Everyone should code" is incorrect - 

It takes years of focus and skill to obtain a high enough level of skill to solve complex problems.
Average people with average capability do not have the time in 3 years to build the required level of skill industry requires.
Most people do not apply themselves full time during the course of a degree, they just turn up to lectures and 80% of them pass.
They were not screened on entry to the university because the university is desperate for numbers to keep their courses alive.

In the UK; The office for students will only allow a university to run a course if it has an 80%+ pass rate. [citation]
No relevant GCSE's or A-Levels, accepted onto CS degrees.
In 2021, 38% of all degree's across the country were awarded 1st class honors (grade inflation. 2010=15%, 2000=10%, 1990=5%) [citation]

    * Look at the grade bump 2020
    * So the introduction of the GCSE in 2014 has made no deference in any way to A-Level results ... why do we bother with GCSE's then? Does education do anything? or has the A-Level got harder?

A Level Computing results - % of national cohort that got A's. 7% consistent. An employer knows what an 'A' means. Employers know that degrees are meaningless [citation]

Academic achievement does not == immediate employable skills.
But academic achievement (when graded as a % nationally) does convey aptitude.
If you can sit down in a chair long enough and focus on something, you're probably useful to an employer.
If you cant prove/manifest that via academic qualification or portfolio of projects, you will struggle to be employed in the domain.

We now have more CS graduates with on average lower IQ's and less personal interest 'studying' (a loose term) the subject.
They are not able to put in the time required to reach a high level of skill in the domain. They are not capable of providing business value in this domain.
The wont pay back their student loans, governments and academic institutions have just wasted these young peoples time and money.

Most people don't need Computer Science
=======================================

* Most people don't need Computer Science
* Most people need digital competence

What do the two look like?
