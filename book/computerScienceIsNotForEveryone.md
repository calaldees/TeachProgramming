'Anyone can code' considered harmful - Computer Science is not for everyone - Why CS must be gate-kept (and celebrated privately)
====================================

This is not an argument against education. This is an argument against misplaced education.

* Not everyone 'needs' to code
* Not everyone is capable of coding

"Everyone can code" is incorrect - rhetoric is harmful and leads to demoralization.
"Everyone should code" is incorrect - 

It takes years of focus and skill to obtain a high enough level of skill to solve complex problems.
Average people with average capability do not have the time in 3 years to build the required level of skill industry requires.
Most people do not apply themselves full time during the course of a degree, they just turn up to lectures and 80% of them pass (see OFS below).
They were not screened on entry to the university because the university is desperate for numbers to keep their courses alive and every student == money.

In the UK; The office for students will only allow a university to run a course if it has an 80%+ pass rate. [citation]
No relevant GCSE's or A-Levels, accepted onto CS degrees.
In 2021, 38% of all degree's across the country were awarded 1st class honors (grade inflation. 2010=15%, 2000=10%, 1990=5%) [citation]

* [[environment]]
* Teacher creates the energy and space
The microcosum self identifies the skill and achivement internally. The rest of the world does not need to see it or care.

Paradox: private it better - but nobody knows that you exisit if you're too private. Balance of privacy and conveyance, but mainly for the in group, not for general observers

A computing teacher can foster this.
Links to other small computing geographical groups/networks could be beneficial.
Online comunities are not the same.
If a young person makes a box move across the screen, the wider internet does not care. Most of their friends don't care. Even "Learn to code" groups online don't care. Parents don't care. The computing teacher and the fellow germinating computerlets do care.
The group knows.

School bands.
Single band struggle
Audience don't know what's involved in preparing a set. They see infinately better produced content on YouTube. Saturated by so much that the bar is high and they can't identify whats involved.
When multiple school bands play, the year 10's doing it for the first time and year 13's that are experienced rock ledgends (to the little'ns)
Timing is all out, mix is aweful. Gutar tone is shocking, pintches of feedback. Wrong verse repeated. But FUCK YEAH! they got to the end of a song. Do you know how hard it is to do that?! The culmination of a year of home pracice, practic as a group. Aligning on what to play. Overcoming the nerves and seeing it though. Only to have someone who can't play any music take a video and put it on their discord/chat staying "lol; loosers"
The computing crew making a square move across the screen are celebrated by their peers. The mood is lead by the teacher.
> Show me the incentives and I'll show you the behavior (cite famous dude)
It's is the teachers responsibility to craft this mood mantra and space.
(Like with the band concept). Only when the Year 13's all the way down to year 9 are in place, can the engine/identify/comunity of the computing room flourish ... It takes a minimum of 5 years at an institution to build this. Now the penny drops as to how hard this is a achieve.


We can't go back to the old days of the internet. Those days will never return.
What we can do is create our smaller comunity echo systems and shut out the noise of the rest of the world to give a focus space with a clear mission and purpose. In order the thrive the community must be largely disconnected.
Punk scene in Japan, Demoscene in finland, Ticking community in 2000, 


We now have more CS graduates with on average lower IQ's and less personal interest 'studying' (a loose term) the subject.
They are not able to put in the time required to reach a high level of skill in the domain. They are not capable of providing business value in this domain.
The wont pay back their student loans, governments and academic institutions have just wasted these young peoples time and money.

Most people don't need Computer Science
=======================================

* Most people don't need Computer Science
* Most people need digital competence

What do the two look like?
Why our education structure is currently not fit for purpose in this domain
