Nonsense like: Computational Thinking
-------------------------------------

"Computational Thinking" is a term used in computing education.
It is not a term that is used or understood by the wider Computer Science world.

The wikipedia page largely encapsulates my thoughts
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking
Jeannette Wing 2006, largely US based, moved to more of the western education in 2015, largely unused elsewhere.
The criticisms listed are largely spot on

Educationalists argue that "Computational Thinking" can be applied to other domains.
What task can a student with good "Computational Thinking Skills" do that other students cant? The answer, not much. (Citation ...)
This is an example of well meaning educationalists not actually being able to create something of value in the domain they are supposed to be advanced in.
Educators that can't actually build software tend to emphasis the wrong foundations as "important".
This leads to loss of trust (especially as learners become more advanced/capable in the later teenage years. They can sniff the bullshit and detach from education rather than just obeying continuous instructions).
I would wager that "Computational Thinking" has been responsible for increased disengagement with Computing.
I actually think it has done harm to the subject.

I asked a table of professional developers, without context, "what is 'Computational Thinking'". None of them could answer. They got as far as "Thinking like a computer" and moved on to talking about the capabilities of AI.

When I revealed
* decomposition (breaking down problems) -> Better technical term: Reverse engineering
* pattern recognition (finding similarities) -> 
* abstraction (ignoring irrelevant details) -> 
* algorithm design (creating step-by-step instructions) -> code

Why are we disadvantaging our young people, by giving them useless terminology that has no bearing in the outside world and how problems are actually solved.
It is more important that we convey the use of correct technical language for our discipline rather than invent our own special education terms.
(I've see teachers making quiz/exam questions asked to define Computational Thinking)
If they show up in the workplace and diligently say "Let's solve this problem with computational thinking", the room of professionals would be unphased, humor them and then get on with solving the problem.

I'm going to translate all the nonsense and misunderstanding about "Computational Thinking" and convey it in ultra simple terms.
"Can you code it?"
We're done ...
Because if you can actually get a computer to perform the operations required, you have to have broken the problem down and solved it. ergo you have thought algorithmically and understood components of a system.

I don't think "Computational Thinking" needs to be called out explicitly.
I think the name is misleading and confusing for most people.
'The proof is in the pudding' of implementation.
Thinking alone is largely ephemeral.
Manifestation of a solution in concrete.
Additional simplification
"Just build some shit"
