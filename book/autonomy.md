Learner Autonomy
================

Largely the punchline of the BarCamp 2024 talk


#### Game-ification is counter to autonomy

* Game-ification of content erodes autonomy and should not be used
  * > You get 50 stars if you complete this exercise - you have 279 stars currently - your next level of silver is at 300 stars
  * This is not developing intrinsic motivation and puts the leaner as a controlled subject rather than developing there own autonomy
  * I would consider this strategy over the long term dangerous.



'Be creative' an art analogy
----------------------------

You have an empty canvas in front of you. Your told 'be creative'. You have the entire world of possibilities, except, you've never used water colours before, you've never used pastles, you used crayons once in primary school. You don't have any tools. There is no paintbrush. There is nothing. Just the canvas.

Maybe you could lick the canvas? or maybe you just get bored and walk away.

You can't 'be create' without _having any of the tools_ or _understanding of the tools_.

You have a blank screen with a flashing cursor in front of you. 'be creative' ...


Having any of the tools
-----------------------

Many institutions to protect/safeguard their learners, lock down and restrict the computers they can use. (I would scarcely call them a computer, I think they are just web browsers with a word processor, in fact mostly just a web browser).
* Ability to install new tooling
    * The classic 'admin access'
    * commandline or application
    * terminal access
* Network
    * No ethernet ports locked to mac address
    * Access to github
    * ports other than 80 and 443

* Supervising technitions need
    * ability to reset machines as quickly as possible (sub 5min would be amazing)
    * If you really want to monitor the use of the network (optional)
        * Keep a log of the dns lookups matched to mac address's
        * log all IP's that don't map to any of the dns lookups
    * external (host their own websites/domains)


### hardware

I don't think all-in-one machines are suitable for computing education

hardware desintegrates in the hands of children. usb ports become damaged. keys break off keyboards. screens get damaged.
All the components need to be cheap (almost disposeable) and replaceable

The budget must facilitate this

### software

As a school/university; You don't need to pay for software to teach computing.
Any restriction an institution makes by buying software, prevents young people from participating at home


Understanding of the tools
