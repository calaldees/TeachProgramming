If I was HOD of a computing department. I am interested in culture/process. I am not too worried about 'raw performance'. I am more concerned with proactive attitude and progress. I'm training them to leave my team (maybe to run their own department in a few years) [sounds crazy, but that's the reality, admit it, run with it]. I want them to leave my team with stonking CV!

Timetabled time (20 hours - half a ks3 class?)

1. 'Explore time' (16 hours - per year)
    * I would mandate that 30min a week (cumulative) is used to undergo an online course of some sort.
        * Self directed (autonomy and personal interest of the teacher)
            * e.g. Future Learn [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi)
    * At the end of each term, every member of the department informally describes the course/experience/content (10min?). Maybe loads up some of the documents or has a screenshot to prompt the talk.
        * If good enough and comfortable - share exactly the same informal demo with another department team (and suggest reciprocation?)
2. Inter institution collaboration (3 hours - per year)
    * I would mandate that 30min a term (6 terms) - you have a video call with another computing teacher in another institution to discuss our sow, policies, progress, concerns, action-areas - and hear the same from them - advice?
    * At the end of each term (3 terms), every member of the department informally (120seconds) describes what was discussed and highlights from these conversations
3. Every staff enrol as an exam board examiner (GCSE or A-Level)
    * (timetabled use of Y11/Y13 time in school - yes I want my team to use school time and be paid additional for this - this cheeky manipulation because the reality will also take more of my employees time outside school, so this is a time win)

Even if your HOD does not direct you to do these ... I would do them autonomously.

TASK: Take a contact of two people in this room now! Put a date to get in touch in your personal calendar.

A Team? Other concepts
1. multiple teachers in the department do the assignment
    * to create model answers bank
    * and discuss (assessment/misconceptions)
2. Pair planning? (30min per week - timetabled?)
3. Pair Marking? (30min per week - timetabled?) (even if they are sitting quietly working on their own stuff - at least it's the same domain)


* Impact Chartered College of Teaching: [Leading teacher collaboration in subject-specific pedagogy](https://my.chartered.college/impact_article/leading-teacher-collaboration-in-subject-specific-pedagogy/) Sep 2020 
    * > To support collaboration between teachers, leaders need to allocate resources and time. Literature indicates that this is a genuine issue in teacher development (Timperley et al., 2007; Greany, 2017; OECD, 2019). To give this work priority, all teaching staff attend a weekly session for one hour after school. This replaces the department meeting. To emphasise our identity as a professional learning community, we hold our sessions in the school hall and teachers sit in their specialisms.
    * > investing in teacher learning has an effect size of 0.84 on student achievement (Robinson, 2011)
    * > subject leaders focus their teams on a single lesson to be taught the following week
    * > Teachers then write a model answer for the end-of-unit assessment task
      > ...
      > Having been through the steps needed to produce the model answers themselves, teachers are able to give clear and detailed explanations and anticipate where misconceptions arise (Rosenshine, 2010; Coe et al., 2014).

TASK1 (10min): Think (solo) of how you would run your dream Computing department
TASK2 (10min): Roleplay - asked to come to front and address your Computing team (thats us) for the year ahead
